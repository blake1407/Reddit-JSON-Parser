And if it doesnt work then he can always claim he always meant to accept the result.Either way, a piece of shit. You dont stay silent for two days after an election in a democracy. Im so so happy he lost.",

It is easy to forget that democracy doesnâ€™t just happenâ€”it requires people to care about the institutions, otherwise they start to disappear as soon as the first power-hungry unscrupulous populist comes along.The United States managed to survive one attempt to disregard longstanding traditions and institutional norms. Iâ€™m not convinced it can withstand a second assault without enough people in positions of power willing to defend it.And this pattern is equally true in every democracy.The worst part is that the wealthy are the least likely to suffer. Itâ€™ll be ethnic and religious minorities, poor people, and the intelligentsia who are hurt most. History is replete with so many examples I donâ€™t even need to list them here.",

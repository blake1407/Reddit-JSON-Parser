And if it doesnt work then he can always claim he always meant to accept the result. Either way, a piece of shit. You dont stay silent for two days after an election in a democracy. Im so so happy he lost.",

Rio de Janeiro - Truckers and other protesters on Tuesday blocked highways for second day in support of President Jair Bolsonaro, who has yet to accept his election loss to leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. The president has remained largely silent since the election results were announced, but Lulas victory was recognized by several Bolsonaro allies, and leaders from around the world - including allies of the president in China and Russia - offered congratulations to Lula. Traffic police chief Silvinei Vasques came under fire for posting an Instagram story on election day urging Brazilians to vote for Bolsonaro. . Extended Summary.

It is easy to forget that democracy doesn’t just happen—it requires people to care about the institutions, otherwise they start to disappear as soon as the first power-hungry unscrupulous populist comes along. The United States managed to survive one attempt to disregard longstanding traditions and institutional norms. I’m not convinced it can withstand a second assault without enough people in positions of power willing to defend it. And this pattern is equally true in every democracy. The worst part is that the wealthy are the least likely to suffer. It’ll be ethnic and religious minorities, poor people, and the intelligentsia who are hurt most. History is replete with so many examples I don’t even need to list them here.",

Looks like Bolsonaro’s voters and supporters have been brainwashed. . He can do pretty much everything, including the insurgence of a military coup, threatening and harassing women, racism, xenophobia, homophobia and they will still support this lunatic!. They desperately need an intervention… but a psychiatric intervention not a military one…",

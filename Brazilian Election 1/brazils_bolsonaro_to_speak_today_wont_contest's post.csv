There wont be foreign support if he tries anything. That would tank the economy and his hold on power even if he tried. The US, major EU states, China and even fuckin Putin in Russia already congratulated Lula on the victory.",

(Santos-Cruz, a highly respected retired general who survived his helicopter being hit in Congo is one; also, vice-president General Hamilton Mourao also seems to not support him). But its also the money people. Big companies dont want a coup.",

Obviously, its wonderful and unifying when they do so. . The problem is - it helps give the false impression that the election results have to be ratified by the losing candidates; and until that happens the election results are somehow in question. Thats not how democracies work.",

Steadfast also didnt feel really good to be fair.Thanks for the feedback. I am eager to try out some of the ideas other people have.",

So that maybe why you have less proc chance for them but all the find x skills are all the same.I dont understand the stablehand unable to use speed weapons there is a shock sword in the loadout shop which is a perfect weapon for the stablehand and makes speed a great stat to spec into. There are goblin knives and with speed evasion is able to be built however strength and strength armor has no evasion equipment so its impossible to spec into evasion (where evasion is better than armor/resistance especially in the end game)  when going strength (which is a problem for woodcutters)Farmers build scarecrow ability is actually pretty consistent compared to steadfast on Balcksmith because steadfast only works on physical attacks and taunt no longer gives a physical and magical defense boost. So a farmer will get more from their ability due to a 35% chance to proc build scarecrow but overall they are the same as blacksmith as a class that needs eager as well.",

Educational_Return_5, t2_7km6860j, t1_kczlclv, t3_18g811y, 12/11/23 22:03, 1, 0, For stablehand Speed weapons are viable. They pierce so they always do max damage and getting max speed on him only requires a few items which lets you wear +DMG gear. Not to mention that speed gear has evasion which is arguably the best defense. You can get 60+ easily and then use evade for 100% dodge chance.,

Erectorz, t2_fpv4w, t1_kcz1rzf, t1_kcz08jr, 12/11/23 20:03, 1, 0, mules give +attack buff, 
MrBoof100, t2_t8de2vs, t1_kcz08jr, t3_18g811y, 12/11/23 19:39, 1, 0, Quick note about friar. I haven’t played in 2-3 weeks so maybe this changed. I believe the fahrule mule is the booze that gives another primary attack (sorry if I’m wrong here). I’ve got a 4 man friar game going and I’m almost positive the spreading of +1 primary attack doesn’t actually spread. Please correct me if the recent updates fixed this though. When I played the ability procs and it shows the other character getting the +1 primary but then on that other character’s turn still had one primary., 
ddaveo, t2_lenah, t1_kd4txwz, t1_kd1bves, 12/11/23 19:39, 1, 0, I can recommend trying it for sure. The stablehand is less about heavy damage and more about debuffs. Having said that though the alternate attack on each speed weapon is armour-piercing so in practice he often hits higher than the "heavy" classes because their attacks get blunted by armour and his doesn\t.I suggest starting the stablehand with the shock sword and used goblin wraps if you have them. By the final dungeon you want him to have 60+ evasion a focus pipe a range of poison/bleed/shock knives a buckler with "evade up group" ability (if you can find it) and a ton of panax. He\ll easily perform on par with the basic strength classes., 
Erectorz, t2_fpv4w, t1_kd1bves, t1_kczry8u, 12/12/23 22:34, 1, 0, I havent found many speed weapons worth using. The base damage of speed weapons are pretty low compared to strength but maybe i wasnt paying attention to them. And using a status weapon is a pretty cool idea ill have to try that out.", 
ddaveo, t2_lenah, t1_kczry8u, t3_18g811y, 12/11/23 22:50, 1, 0, > He basically cannot use any weapons other than strength weapons howeverThats not right. Stablehand is wasted with strength weapons. I find hes best with knives or even just the shock sword for the entire run. Give him the junk herbs and let him poison or shock every opponent on the grid before anyone else even gets a turn. Give him all the high speed/evasion gear you find and hell hardly ever get hit either.Or alternatively give him the lucky trait and the black cat and he can swap to the toy hammer when you find it in a night market. With 95 luck he can stun/confuse most your opponents right at the start of the fight which is invaluable in fights against higher level opponents.", 
Cryoptic-, t2_tuauf8he, t1_kda0uyr, t1_kd7qfsp, 12/11/23 22:50, 1, 0, They can be interpreted the same way. Often used interchangeably however the game clearly uses vitality for the name. Not a huge issue but thought I’d mention it , 
Erectorz, t2_fpv4w, t1_kd7qfsp, t1_kd6asbf, 12/13/23 23:02, 1, 0, .......I really thought it was fortitude. I have no idea why its clearly vitality, 
Cryoptic-, t2_tuauf8he, t1_kd6asbf, t3_18g811y, 12/13/23 08:06, 1, 0, Not that it matters a whole lot but man did it annoy me to read fortitude instead of vitality haha.Also doesn’t the friar start with a INT mace that is physical and an INT shield?,

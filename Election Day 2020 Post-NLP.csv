The official result is given weeks later after states certify provisional ballots and triple check their math. Usually it doesnt make a difference but this year some people seem to have the impression that any vote counting after election night is not allowed/fake/fraud/whatever else. -the first vote counts reported mean nothing this year. Due to the fact that theres a big partisan difference in vote by mail results will look way more tilted than the normally would depending on which is counted first. For example Georgia does mail in balloting first so its likely to swing more liberal and then get more conservative as the nights go on. Pennsylvania due to reporting in person ballots first will look significantly more conservative at first and then will likely tick towards Biden as mail in votes are counted. Early vote counts mean nothing this year. -Dont trust any declarations of victory on election night. Like I said the first reported results are unlikely to be the final results.

He has teamed up with former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg to help ensure that felons in Florida will be able to vote. “The multimillion-dollar effort by Michael Bloomberg LeBron James and other celebrities to pay off lingering court fines and fees for Florida felons could make almost 13000 of them eligible to vote in Tuesday’s election an analysis by the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald and ProPublica found” wrote Lawrence Mower and Langston Taylor of the Tampa Bay Times. Florida could end up being the state that decides whether President Donald Trump wins a second term or Joe Biden becomes the 46th president of the United States. In 2018 the people of the Sunshine State voted to allow felons to exercise their constitutional right to vote in elections. However earlier this year the state legislature amended the law and required that felons pay all outstanding fines and fees to be legally allowed to vote. It’s thought that allowing such residents to vote in Florida could be the tipping point that allows Biden to win there.

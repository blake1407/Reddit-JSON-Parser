It really is a model of how elections should be run in this country - I was able to get an SMS when my ballot was mailed to me, and when it didnt arrive after 2 weeks, I was able to go vote in person.   And then I got an SMS when my early ballot was received, validated, and counted!",

However, its not over yet, we likely wont know the results in WI, MI, or PA tonight unfortunately due to mail-in votes still being counted. Edit: Biden’s AZ victory has now been confirmed by the Associated Press, in case you wanted a source besides Fox.",

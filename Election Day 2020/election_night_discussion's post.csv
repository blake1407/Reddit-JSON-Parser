Im sure many of yall are glued to your TV screens right now, but for those who arent this post is for comments/reactions/discussion. . Important facts to remember:. -Election night results are just projections that news agencies do. The official result is given weeks later after states certify provisional ballots and triple check their math. Usually it doesnt make a difference, but this year some people seem to have the impression that any vote counting after election night is not allowed/fake/fraud/whatever else. -the first vote counts reported mean nothing this year. Due to the fact that theres a big partisan difference in vote by mail, results will look way more tilted than the normally would depending on which is counted first. For example, Georgia does mail in balloting first, so its likely to swing more liberal and then get more conservative as the nights go on. Pennsylvania, due to reporting in person ballots first, will look significantly more conservative at first, and then will likely tick towards Biden as mail in votes are counted. Early vote counts mean nothing this year. -Dont trust any declarations of victory on election night. Like I said, the first reported results are unlikely to be the final results. News agencies are typically good at projecting the correct winner, but its unlikely well even get that until tomorrow. Have a good day everyone.",

Her dad passed in 2008, and he always worried he wouldn’t see a Black President in his lifetime. His next birthday was the day Obama was elected. We talked about how they would’ve dealt with the virus, laughing that my Nana would’ve been insistent on coming up to stay with my mom and my Papa would’ve scolded her and bought a million masks and TP on day one. And pork chops. He loved pork chops. I miss them so fucking much, and I’m glad they didn’t have to suffer through this administration, but god fucking dammit if I don’t do my part to rectify this and build the world they wanted for us.",

There are milestones in late-adult life you anticipate going through with your children, and when good or even bad things would happen to the family after his death, there was always this noticeable void. Like, the unheard voice, the missing opinion, the hole in the heart, etc. I can’t imagine what it must be like to face a presidential election with so many loved ones lost. My mom is gone now and my brother has been gone twice as long, and I still find myself being like, I wish I could tell them about this! I hate that they don’t know! Would they be proud? Would they have advice?. It makes sense to me he would visit his son on this day. As much as we want to make our parents proud, parents want to make their children proud, too. . Politics aside, you can’t deny Joe is a good man with a lot of empathy to offer a country that needs it more than ever. The US is looking at 400,000 deaths by February. We need his help.",

The pain and suffering hes had to endure is startling. Sometimes it takes someone who deals with that type of loss to help guide us. Well see how it goes tonight.",

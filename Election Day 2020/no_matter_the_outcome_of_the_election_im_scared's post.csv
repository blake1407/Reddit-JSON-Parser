I just wish we could all get a long and have a bit more understanding of each other. The two party system is and has been truly dividing our nation and it is saddening. I'm sure there are going to be some riots, and people aren't going to want to concede either way. People have been saying this is the finale of 2020 and I agree, lol. 2020 is an absolute mess. Edit: wow didn't expect this to get so much attention, thanks for all the awards! Go exercise your right to vote and be safe out there everyone!",

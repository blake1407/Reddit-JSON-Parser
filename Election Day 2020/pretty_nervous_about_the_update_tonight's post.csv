The patch notes for 20.21.1.20 are probably gonna be a big considering the arguments over the forums about who should get the President rank. Im considering switching to the Canada server for a couple months considering that no matter who wins, there’s probably gonna be a lot of violence. But hey. You never know. Edit: The players The devs don’t have much to do with the Election event.",

Im betting that we see daily patches for at least a week (and possibly a lot longer) before they get it nailed down.",

We will find out who the controlling party and what shift in politics views will dominate, but that won’t take effect until January 20th. . It kind of sucks there is such a long gap between patch notes and the patch actually going into effect. The current patch can still do a lot of damage in 3 months even if the patch notes say a change is inevitable Jan 20",

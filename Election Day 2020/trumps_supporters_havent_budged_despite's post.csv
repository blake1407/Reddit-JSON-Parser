Thats the scariest part.",

They hate entitlements because theyre reserved for special groups who qualify. They hate minorities because they feel that theyre taking away their culture.  They hate the educated because they feel looked down upon.  They do not hate the wealthy because they believe they will someday join their ranks. With all this in mind, its near impossible for someone to shake loose from supporting someone who tells them that its okay to feel all these things.",

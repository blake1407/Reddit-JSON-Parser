He has teamed up with former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg to help ensure that felons in Florida will be able to vote. “The multimillion-dollar effort by Michael Bloomberg, LeBron James and other celebrities to pay off lingering court fines and fees for Florida felons could make almost 13,000 of them eligible to vote in Tuesday’s election, an analysis by the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald and ProPublica found,” wrote Lawrence Mower and Langston Taylor of the Tampa Bay Times. Florida could end up being the state that decides whether President Donald Trump wins a second term or Joe Biden becomes the 46th president of the United States. In 2018, the people of the Sunshine State voted to allow felons to exercise their constitutional right to vote in elections. However, earlier this year, the state legislature amended the law and required that felons pay all outstanding fines and fees to be legally allowed to vote. It’s thought that allowing such residents to vote in Florida could be the tipping point that allows Biden to win there. Link to article",

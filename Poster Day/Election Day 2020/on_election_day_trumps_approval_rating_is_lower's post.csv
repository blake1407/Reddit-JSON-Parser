I saw him teach Sunday School a couple years ago, and even as an atheist his peaceful message was touching and universal. When asked questions about the latest news (this was May 2018) he could tell you exactly where we were with the North Korea situation, and wished Trump well in laying down the steps to peace. . ​. When Carter asked guests how far many of them traveled from, one of them said "Washington DC!" out of excitement. Without missing a beat, the twinkle in his eye grew, he grinned and said "oh, I used to live there!" Hes one of my favorite ex-presidents and one I think of frequently when I wonder how presidents do when theyre done. Hes done so much in the past forty years that I hope another post president can live up to some of that.",

Its disgraceful that someone of Trumps clearly narcissistic, racist, misogynistic and authoritarian ilk can show better approval ratings. Hope you guys get a better government soon.",

The men are polar opposites and Jimmy Carter doesn’t deserve to be associated with losers.",

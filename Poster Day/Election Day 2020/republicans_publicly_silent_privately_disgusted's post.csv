(Though it is really in effect until every republican who served during the trump term is removed from the taxpayer teat.). 20 years of selecting zero republicans on any ballot.  Not just because you selected trump but because you continued to support him.   Not just because you stole a Supreme Court seat, but because you said those same rules wouldnt apply to you.   Not just because you did nothing when hearing about American troop bounties, but because you actually buried it.   Not just because you killed 100k+ extra Americans via Covid-19, but because you blamed.  well, everything but you.   Not just because you ran a kangaroo impeachment trial, but because you used it to go after other people not even on trial.   Not  just because you are packed with white supremacists, but because you  continue to think you are better than whole races simply because of your  race.   Not just because you hate immigrants, but because you still want them here for slavery lower wages, you just dont want them to have any rights.   Not  just because you selected a pedophile for an election, but because  youre so jaded he ran again the next election still thinking youd vote  for him. And many of you did.   Not just because your religion has debatable rules, but because you hold other people to the rules of your religion.   Not just because you think BLM is inappropriately singular, but because you think blue lives matter isnt the same thing.   Not  just because deficits are only a concern when youre not at the till,  but because you actually grow the deficit far quicker when you are, and in a way that benefits practically none of us.   And  lastly, not just because of what trump has done in a few short years,  but because none of it was against what you would have done without him.  He just used his outside voice.",

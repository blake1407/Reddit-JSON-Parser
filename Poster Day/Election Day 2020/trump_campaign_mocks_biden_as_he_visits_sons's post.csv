So the reporters can go home or back to their hotel rooms. Its an insult here, because theyre implying Biden has so little energy that he would be calling a lid this early in the day.",

Actually, Fox puts him on more than anybody else, which is just sort of shocking to me, because Fox has changed a lot.”. Trump, is on Fox, complaining about how Fox is pumping up Biden. Wat.",

All of his family members that came to the funeral were all "we are so sorry for your loss" "we miss him" blah blah blah. . Then on social media they talk about how they support Trump.  The man who has not had a health care plan since his last election campaign. . My dad while being treated for cancer couldn  get the recommended treatment the doctor wanted so he had to do a experimental treatment that put him in a diabetic comma and gave him diabetes when he never had it his entire life. . Healthcare is an issue that hits home with me. If we actually had a competent leader with an actual plan my time with my father could have potentially been longer. All of my family are such hypocrites. . I just want to say Im so happy you have so far beaten this ugly disease. FUCK CANCER. . EDIT:  Thank you all for the kind words. I am giving out "I Voted" gildings to all of you for sharing your kindness and love with me.",

Weve lost so many Americans, especially this year to Covid. We need to mourn those weve lost, as well as the aspects of our country that have been atrophied because of this tyrannical administration. Remembering, solemnly, all thats lost, and everything we hope to regain as a country is vitally important.",

I’m kind of at my mental breaking point with my dad. He’s in a cult. He needs to be deprogrammed. It like, hurts to see.

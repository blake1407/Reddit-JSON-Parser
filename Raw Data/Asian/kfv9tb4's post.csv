I think i just experienced my first ever overt racist experience. I was hopping off of the muni bus when I was bumped real hard by a young black man. Then he proceeded to tell me “what? Go back to your country”."

Have also been spat on at Union Square, by a black guy who I see proceed to spit on two other asian groups as well. . On Nextdoor someone posted they followed the guy and saw him spit on a dozen mostly asian people and called the cops, but the cop said he didnt see it happen"""

I have a question I’ve been asking myself since their “breakup” but does anyone else feel like Taylor kind of did him dirty. Like she likely cheated w Joe on him and then rebounded with him, threw it in joes face and Matty goes through hell from the press, swifties etc (not all unwarranted but some of it was) and then she’s like yeah never-mined, this  . Is hurting my brand, peace. And jack uninvites him to the wedding, he’s off the album and he’s hated all over world. Am I the only one who thinks he didn’t really deserve that?"
SwiftlyNeutral,siaslial,t29vin7,t1kfvpy4x,t1kfvkspj,,1,2,0,0,"""He’s always doing the same shit again and again and again and then all he has to do is make a sad face while drinking onstage and pretending to lurch about while saying something like he’s now leaving his asshole era, but also making sure he gets in a little ‘poor me though’ moment. I promise you he pulls this shit because he likes it and wants the attention from it but then also needs to be soothed by fans who swear they get his misunderstood softie vibe too. Completely exhausting and fake af. Even if all he did on the podcast was laugh (and that wasn’t all he did), he’s gross for it and he wants to be around these people for a reason. He’s playing his fans like a fiddle."""
SwiftlyNeutral,slipperypole,t213spgv,t1kfvkspj,t1kfvkm6e,01/01/24 15:49,4,23,0,1,"""He realised he went too far and stopped doing it since February? Apologised to everyone involved? How sad your life must be if you never let anyone grow or improve?"""
SwiftlyNeutral,siaslial,t29vin7,t1kfvkm6e,t1kfviemt,01/01/24 15:19,3,2,0,1,"""I hope this is just Stan goggles and you don’t excuse men IRL for just being a “toxic man character!” when they’re literally just doing toxic misogynistic shit for fun, I mean jfc the bar is rolling on the floor. Bestie, he just likes doing this stuff and gets off on it and knows he can just later do a wink wink and say IT WAS ALL A CHARACTER. That doesn’t even make any sense lol? Seek standards."""
SwiftlyNeutral,slipperypole,t213spgv,t1kfviemt,t1kfvhpdz,01/01/24 15:05,2,31,0,1,"""He spent 2 legs of a tour in toxic man character. Then went on a comedy podcast in that same character. It was stupid of him and he has apologised multiple times on stage. As for the demasculating comments, he clarified in a 2 page letter if you want actual context and not a witch-hunt:. """
SwiftlyNeutral,LowMathematician96,t27jil6ijt,t1kfvm1f4,t1kfvhpdz,01/01/24 15:26,1,22,0,0,"""well… yes? - except the demasculating thing that he explained in length- Why is it so hard for people to grasp commentary that are not literal and not erase the context of everything …. he is from a british punk/rock band. What do you expect? I get that’s not everyone cup of tea and that he can be very clumsy but his activism and stand on many issues (lgbtq+, climate change, RACISM) is beyond anything tay, bless her american heart, has ever done… so I find it quite funny when people from this fandom come at him on those matters"""
SwiftlyNeutral,Agentbeeressler,t2krntcwue,t1kfvhpdz,t1kfvhffv,01/01/24 15:00,1,18,0,2,"""Yes, it’s all a joke! And him posting islamaphobic stuff is also a joke! And him making fun of Asian people is also a joke! And him saying Taylor is demasculating is also a joke! Bffr"""

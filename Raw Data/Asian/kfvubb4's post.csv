Japan is different architecture and culture like you said as well as food and like all the things because it’s literally a different place. Visiting Canada and pretending it’s Italy because you always wanted an Italian girlfriend is fucking wild and weird in a bad way. I don’t think it’s any different here."""

Chinese culture and architecture are noticeably different from Japanese culture and architecture. . Is this all about him grouping all Asian peoples together and walking around a place seeing mostly Asian people?"""

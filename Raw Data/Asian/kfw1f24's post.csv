Just wanna state that as men and women in a society, I think we have very different experiences of sex. I think society has really warped what sex is and supposed to be to the point that as humans we really don’t know what it is like to discover and explore sex as something natural and primal. I think society grooms us all on some level. Please, if you are a man, take no offense to what I have to say. I am not leaving the male perspective out of the discussion because I think your experiences don’t matter, I am leaving the male perspective out of the discussion because I think men and women have their own unique experiences and I cannot speak to the male experience as anything more than an outsider. . &nbsp;. This post is hopefully meant to remind and empower women that struggle with their sexuality and sexual repression. &nbsp;. I don’t know about you ladies, but I have realized that society has really bastardized sex into something that I have began to loath. Something meant to symbolize trust and love between two beings, something meant to create life… has become something else entirely. &nbsp;. Men bonding over your objectification is not ok. Men lying and pestering and pressuring you into sex is not ok. You don’t owe sex to anyone. Your pleasure is important and if a man loves and values you, he will want to make sure you enjoy the experience. If you’re not ready, you don’t have to sleep with someone just to please them. You can wait and set boundaries and establish trust. If he is good, he will understand and trust me there are SO MANY good men. . &nbsp;. Your worth and value as a human being does not depreciate with each person you have sex with. Sex is not degrading and it is not degenerative. If someone makes you feel degraded or dirty or unloved after sex, that is on them NOT you. If someone forces themselves onto you, or harasses you, or diminishes your experiences… that is their failure as decent human beings NOT YOURS. No one can take power from you, they can only convince you that they have. Own your body. It is yours. Force and coercion is not your fault. It is not because you are weak, but because someone else is. If your choice is ever taken, it says NOTHING about who you are as a person. &nbsp;. Sex is NOT supposed to be performative. You do not need to be or look or act like a porn star in order to be good enough for you partner. Your value as a person is not tied to how attractive society deems you. There are many men out there who will love and appreciate your natural beauty as a woman and not this fake image of what a woman is supposed to look like. Body hair is not masculine. Flat chestedness is not masculine. Short hair is not masculine. You are perfect the way that you are. If you are a woman, then everything natural about you is feminine. No one else can define what you are as a woman, because it is innate and inherent in who you are. Find a man who loves and appreciates your natural beauty and who doesn’t expect you to conform to the cruel and dehumanizing and shallow depictions of what a woman “should” be, as society has defined it. &nbsp;. Don’t be afraid to be alone. I promise you, loneliness comes from sacrificing and suppressing who you are so that you can be what others want you to be. Be who you are, who you want to be, and do so relentlessly. Love who you want to love. Take pride in the person you were born as, because despite society trying to make you think otherwise; you are who you are and there is beauty to that. Beauty that doesn’t needs the approval of others. . &nbsp;. Sex is such a beautiful, intimate thing. It represents trust, love, and creation. Respect it like any drug and steer clear of those who don’t. Don’t let society taint something so natural and important and innocent. Don’t let it be weaponized against you."

For the most part, in the majority of cases, there is a female and a male biological body type. This is what has influenced culture over thousands of years to enact the idea of ""male"" and ""female"". . >What about when a woman has a hysterectomy? A woman is no less of a woman if she does not have a uterus. So if a man were to change sex and have a fully functional female organ, with hormones and everything, but doesn  have a uterus, wouldn  they still be a woman? Just a woman who can  reproduce?. I have never said a woman without a uterus is less of a woman, or that a trans woman is less of a woman? See, this is the type of antagonising that is problematic. You have now started to debate me, with the assumption that I am anti-trans or something, when I am not. I haven  even said anything at all about trans people. My point above was just as I said: Its easy to see the source of where the cultural idea of a man and woman comes from, when we as a human species are a sexual reproductive species where through history, bar some few cases, all human reproduction have been between male chromosomes (with something that looks like what people think of as a male body) and female chromosomes (with something that looks like what people think of as a female body). That is just a historical fact. I don  agree with 100% binary gender roles, but its the fact that due to the biology is how those things became entrenched in culture. To add to that, I think it is important to recognise that for the majority of people, human experience is still aligned with our typical biology - to be born and to feel like the specific gender that is in line with our biological sex, and to grow up into, and think of the world as mostly filled with people that are either male or female which is mostly in line with their body type. That is not true for everyone and its important to accomodate those too, so that their lives aren  torturous but it is also equally important to recognise the experience of most people and have room for that too. To take your own view on gender and try to shove it down the throats of other people who aren  at all living that experience is also rude and will only make yourself offputting and make people angry. We should aim to coexist peacefully with equal opportunity and shared empathy, not try to control other peoples experience. Telling a trans man that they are less of a man is very bad. But telling a non-trans woman that ""You having a uterus doesn  make you a woman"" is also bad. Both are examples of trying to control someone elses experience. >Saying this at the end of your whole explanation of comparing us to the animal kingdom and all that bs. Science has shown us gender is different than biological sex. Theres been tons of studies on this and all it would take it a quick Google search. Im not ""comparing"" us to the animal kingdom. We ARE part of the animal kingdom. We ARE animals. We have a few hundred thousands of years of history with language, before then we weren  much different to other apes. But again, youre miscontruing my point by instantly flagging me as a trans enemy. Im not saying ""trans people don  exist because look at biology"". Again, Im only saying that ""look at the history of our species, that is why the current state of affairs is the way it is""."""

Psychonaut,slorpa,t2vkoqz7qr,t1kfy1dbz,t1kfw1f24,01/02/24 01:17,2,0,0,1,""">What is the source of the ""man"" or ""woman"" binary and who does it really benefit in the end?. Its pretty easy to see the source of it? As human beings we have put labels to things we see ever since we invented language. Its a very natural thing to notice that generally speaking some humans have a penis and other physical attributes while others have boobs + vagina and other physical attributes. Mix this with the fact that generally speaking, people grew up with 2 closest role models of ""mum"" and ""dad"" which generally speaking had functional roles angling in certain directions over others. Im not arguing with the importance of questioning prejudice and to modernise these things however appropriate (which I think we haven  reached a consensus with yet on how it will look like, btw), but to pretend ignorance on where the traditional male/female roles are coming from doesn  serve the discussion. I also don  buy that it is ""all about power and control"" as that is way too antagonising. If you look at the history of the human species, its not too different to how it has worked in other animals for millions of years. You can  look at all the species where males/females have set physical characteristics, and separate instincts on what functions to follow, and claim that ""its all about power and control"". Its nature, and genetics, and survival of the fittest. Yes, we humans are affected by that too, and we shouldn  try to hide that. We need to acknowledge it, and incorporate it into the picture. Its a complex situation and there are many forces exerting their push and pull. Some of those forces are nature, some are nurture, some are genetics, some are culture, some are power structures, some are toxic, some are lack of empathy, and it all forms a terrain that we are now trying to make sense out of, and to shape into something healthy. Its difficult, and challenging and a trip of its own right. . I loved OPs post because it contributes to these conversations in a healthy way with no prejudice or antagonising of larger groups. I believe above all, in these conversations we need to stay open, and empathic to all sides, to understand the forces at play. Then we can wisely carve our way forward into a healthier cultural way of being that incorporates all parts of us, including our freedom to express freely who we are, with no toxic predudice, but also incorporating the parts that are our genetic and natural history too, in a way that doesn  conflict with the former."""

I hear in tech most leadership positions are held by lesser qualified WM while AM do majority of the real work? Are PE firms, hedge funds, IB and the like similar? It always seems to me upper management like managing director is filled with WM (maybe because of connections) while the maybe more qualified AM is stuck doing number crunching. Like its not enough to be Ivy educated and competent. You have to come from elite WASP social circles and connections."

I worked for one of the top brokerage firms in the US (although Im an IT project manager).  One of the managers would throw a retreat for employees that he considered to be future leaders that was by invitation only.  His saying always was, ""A lot of promotability comes down to relatability.""  The ability to network, form relationships with clients and partner companies, and just get your name out there separates the risers from the guys that plateau. There is some truth to the fact that two people of the same gender and ethnic group will have an easier time relating to each other.  Hence, we operate in systems where white male executives pave the way for future white male executives. But then you look at a company like Zoom that was founded and headed up by an Asian man, Eric Yuan.  Same goes for Nvidia, headed up by Jensen Huang.  You would think that those companies would have more Asians in their executive teams.  Nvidia doesn .  Nvidia has one other Asian executive aside from Huang.  The rest are white.  Zooms board of directors is entirely white aside from Yuan.  Although Zooms management team has three other Asian people and five east Indians. So how did that happen where even companies founded by Asians still have so few Asian people in executive positions?  Overall, Asians are raised to study hard and work hard.  Generally speaking, Asians are not raised to talk a good game, network, schmooze, and brush shoulders with the big wigs.  Just the opposite, many are told that sucking up is bad and not to do it.  My father owned and operated his own small company.  He had a tendency to promote the quiet, hardworking people, while he looked down on the people that he considered the suck ups.  When I got into the workforce, I had to shift my thinking.  Shifting away from my fathers thinking that hard work should be the only thing, into getting myself out there and networking, cultivating relationships inside and outside the company.   . Not just the finance industry, but any industry, young Asian people entering the workplace need to shift away from the old, traditional values."""

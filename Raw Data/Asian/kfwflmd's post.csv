sixers,PersonFromPlace,t2gu3q5,t1kfwi9tu,t1kfwflmd,01/01/24 18:43,2,1,0,0,"""Thank you for your informative response in terms of highlighting the economic benefits and logistical benefits in public transit, though I will say your takes on emotions are a bit too dismissive to the point where it hinders your argument. . Like rather than dismiss it and saying it’s emotionally manipulative, you’re better off acknowledging it. It makes it feel that you’re understanding what the potential other side will experience, you’re acknowledging and respecting fears of change rather than just having a cold heart to it. As well as saying that it doesn’t matter if they’re Asian or not— you’re supposed to look out for small minority groups rather than say it’s okay to inconvenience them since it’s not a lot of people anyway. . Like pulling on the idea that it’s worth it to misfortune others to benefit the whole is not a good way to wrap the argument around. If that’s inescapable then it’s worth acknowledging with respect rather than sweep under the rug. A lot of what you’re saying is convincing but it is noticeably cold hearted to the point of causing hesitation."""

Its literally exactly what the term actually means, and I deliberately used it for the negative connotations, because I want to highlight exactly what people are actually advocating for. . >Like is the effect of that mean that they all get spread out and have to deal with the shitty experience of being the lone Asian person. That shit fucks with you mentally growing up, having the lone Asian kid experience. Being teased for being Asian as a kid did a lot of mental scars for me that took years to unwind. . The city of 7.3% Asain. Im guessing that most of the people who have to move can find somewhere in the area with at least one other Asian family. Chinatown is a handful of city blocks where mostly Asian people live, not the only place in the city where Asian people live. This is the kind of emotionally manipulative catastrophizing that is the only argument against the location.  ""Oh my God, what will these 3000 Asian people do if they don  get to live in a neighborhood named for being full of Asian people?"".  Its beyond ridiculous. . >But idk, it seems like there’s more to this, that most Asians live in Mayfair anyway. I do feel it is weird that there is a lot of talk about Chinatown, but is that just NIMBYs using that as marketing to make it seem like Asian-hate? Or is that actually legitimate? Like do actually want to hear from Asian people who are from there or that would be affected by this. . I can  speak for anyone else, but I just can  stand NIMBYism. And this is the perfect place to build a stadium. Madison Square Garden wouldn  be Madison Square Garden if it wasn  in the middle of Manhattan. And this is as close as you can get to that in Philly. . >I mean Op just said Chinatown is the only place where they feel welcomed. Idk, the lack of representation on this topic seems sus, and the fact that people don’t even seem to care is even more disappointing. . OP is being emotionally manipulative, and the idea that representation is relevant here is whats sus. This is objectively good for everyone with the possible exception of Chinatown residents, if they get priced out. And the worst potential downside for most of them is that it would be inconvenient if they had to move to a comparable location elsewhere in the city or suburbs, and they might be a bit sad they had to leave their old neighborhood behind. This isn  buying up depressed real estate in majority minority areas and then revitalizing an area, locking the minorities who owned the property before out of the profits. The improvement is being built first. Anyone who currently owns property in the area will be the ones profiting if rents go up or they need to sell because they get priced out. . >Like is the general idea that people don’t want to admit is that they don’t care about Asians and just want it closer in the city?. Again, emotionally manipulative nonsense. Its not about ""not caring about Asians"". Whether the people in question are Asian or not is, and should be, irrelevant. This is objectively the best place to put a new arena/live event venue in terms of economic benefit to the city. Its also the best place in terms of benefiting local public transit, and the environment by turning car trips into light rail trips. And finally, its already a retail/entertainment district, and one that needs revitalizing, so its exactly where a new entertainment venue should logically go. There is every rational reason to put the building there. Not putting it there because of optics is bowing to irrationality. The race of the people complaining is irrelevant. Whats relevant is that the potential negative impacts on those few thousand people are tiny compared to the potential positive impacts on the citys tax base and public transit systems, which will benefit orders of magnitude more city residents than might wind up getting displaced."""

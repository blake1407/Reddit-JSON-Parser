Does it make me racist if Im not attracted to Asian people? . Are there any groups of people that you wouldnt date? Or people that you arent attracted to. . Im African by the way. Liberian to be exact. EDIT: Maybe it could be that I just havent seen the right kind of Asian people. Ill tell you about my experiences though so you can understand. Im a straight woman and Ive never once been attracted to ANY asian boy in my class/school. You know those BTS boys that everybody gushes over? Well Im not attracted to any of them either. Ive seen Asian men online and in Aba and Preach videos. I remember watching the video the did about how japanese men are cheaters, I wasnt attracted to any of the dudes that were interviewed. . The closest Ive been to being attracted to an Asian person was seeing one of my highschool teachers. He was japanese I think and I think I was attracted to him. It could have just been his personality though. I still didnt like the color of his skin. Its a little odd to me. I cant change the way I feel about someones looks. This is a very interesting discussion. Thanks for the comments."

How about an African American and a Nigerian? Or an African American and an African British person? How about a Frenchman and a Spaniard?. . Race is a bullshit idea. Personal preference is not."""

There are physical traits that just dont do it for any particular person. High cheekbones, a certain eye shape or body shape, certain hair types, etc. Now, what if an entire subsection of humanity had those traits, in part or in total? You cant help what you find attractive."""

Are you really saying all Japanese, chinese, indian, Korean, Filipino, Vietnamese, Bangladeshi, Indonesian, Mongolian, etc - people are equally unattractive to you? Like really think about it, is that what you’re saying? Because that’s what “I’m not attracted to Asian people” implies. And idk about yall, but that’s racist as fuck."""

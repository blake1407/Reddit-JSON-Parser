If they did, the leads would not be of a certain minority group only. For example, look at the new movie Dashing Through the Snow. Why not have people like Aziz Ansari? Theres a new percy jackson. Annabeth is cast as the same ethnicity as grover and Chiron. Why not have more native americans?. Lets look at Marvels Kang. I could list all where diversity is really just white or blakc. And Im not talking about as side characters. Hollywood for example, would rarely ever have an east Asian as a main lead, especially a man. Sure, female chinese sometimes take center stage. But man? No. I dont believe the whole diversity bs until a native american and asian takes front and center stage on a big budget movie. . Maybe it wasnt obvious but most of my examples were race swapping. Why doesnt any one try race swapping a black character with a native american? . Annabeth, Grover and Chiron should have been Asian or maybe even Polynesian "

Chang wrote something almost verbatim as what you wrote concerning the movie’s melodramatics and force feeding cries. Those cliche characters stem from the storytellers, one being Asian himself, prioritizing story over character. I understand your frustrations with the characters’ archetypes. Since the movie focuses on one family, I do not extrapolate a larger sociological Asian American context. Moreover, since I know Asian families in my own walking life and have seen dozens of different Asian movies, I did not come away with that conclusion at all. However, I know the power of images is limitless, so again, I can understand your frustration, although I did not perceive the characters’ in the ways you described. lol at the numerous ad hominem attacks. I never wrote that the movie was deep. In fact, I said nothing about my perspective on the film. I know a variety of people who did not like the film as well. As with most artworks. , I do not visit rotten tomatoes either. Of course, paid viewings do not equal personal enjoyment or “objective,” quality. Telling others you enjoyed it, publicly, privately, and online, suggests satisfaction. I’m not cynical enough to believe wide swarms of fans were lying. As Justin Chang mentions, the movie had a generational divide among his own family. . Chang also noted, the rabid fanbase, including Asian people, had to be told by 1 of the Daniels to stop harshly engaging the movie’s detractors. If you do not believe Asian Americans were enthusiastic about this movie, then this whole discussion is fruitless. Generalizations can be harmful or useful. I am not saying what will be liked in the future. I know parasite and EEAO are well liked in the present. Not unanimously liked, well liked. . You act as if the 125+ M box office was a foregone conclusion. Awards are won based upon competition level and voting. Sure, the academy is more diverse now than it was thirty years ago, but minorities alone could not have voted EEAO & Moonlight into all those Oscars. . I find it VERY telling that you see Chazelle’s movies excluding race as a factor. I will not go into all the details. Although, in one, the main character bemoans a black jazz musician for being modern  as Kareem wrote, “The white guy wants to preserve the black roots of jazz while the black guy is the sellout?”. & Richard Brody “When Seb meets, grudgingly, with Keith to discuss the offer, the bandleader takes Seb to task, charging that he is killing jazz: “You’re so obsessed with Kenny Clarke and Thelonious Monk—these guys were revolutionaries. How are you going to be a revolutionary if you’re such a traditionalist? You’re holding onto the past, but jazz is about the future.”"""

I’ve heard conservatives say that white privilege is some “left wing nonsense” that universities and the liberal western governments fabricated to divide people up , foster minorities hatred against white people , there’s no such thing as white privilege, anyone can climb up to the top of the social ladder as long as they work hard . So what’s your opinion on this matter? . Do you think white privilege truly exists or just people nowadays being overly sensitive ?"

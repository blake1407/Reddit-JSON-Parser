This issue was clear today when a therapist today cancelled my appointment citing she was ""uncomfortable."" After pressing the issue, the manager told me multiple therapists have mentioned my body odor over the past 2 years. Today, I took a bath before my massage. Manager told me shell speak to my therapist today about the specifics of my odor so I know how to fix. I might need to follow-up until I get more details, but how can I fix my body odor for my massages?. Again, I took a bath today, clean clothes after the bath for 15 minutes, took clothes off except undergarments for massage."

Your sweat glands that are all over your skin are actually different from the sweat glands in your underarms and around your butt - Asian people lack the gene that makes the latter."""

How have you most recently seen it?. Heres where our profession has fallen short, unfortunately. Its not to complain, we should just keep this in mind:. 1. In 2019, AICPA paid out $15,000 because it didnt realize that people who cannot see well might actually be qualified CPAs. Yeah, 2-0-1-9. Hey, Barry Melanson, how many memberships is that buddy? Settlement Agreement between the United States and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (ada.gov) . 2. In the before times (1984), ahem, Californias State Board of Public Accountancy was found by their State Supreme Court to have discriminated against Asian CPAs between 1957-1977. Remember, 1957 is not that many years after the Asian internment camps on the West Coast of the US during WW2. See Korematsu v. US, a blight on the legal profession.  FILIPINO ACCOUNTANTS ASSOCIATION INC v. STATE BOARD OF ACCOUNTANCY (1984). FindLaw . 3. The first black female CPA could not even find a j-o-b in Chicago - if youre having trouble, remember her. This was in the 40s, so she started her own damn firm, this was well before affirmative action, and two other black men joined her. One even became the Chair for the Chicago Fed. Shes died and one of the men sold to BDO in 2018 and her firm is now called Mitchell Titus. What are some ways we can do better?.    "

And I think the answers often begin with well, that was the way it was when I did public accounting - nobody looked like me, nobody cared about my mental health, everyone worked 24/7. Since people often feel their experiences are invalidated, the discussion around diversity needs instead to recognize that most of us come from a good place. Instead, people hide in the shadows. Part of it is the constant negativity towards diversity in every profession - there is almost no research on the disabled CPA because noone wants to admit they are disabled in some way and that they are a CPA. . And as a Controller with a CPA I find this so very sad."""
Accounting,irreverentnoodles,t2esdj1yoy,t1kfzn83q,t1kfzgcmi,01/02/24 17:54,4,1,0,1,"""I would say that cultural influences are just that- influential but not determinative. I don’t disagree that they exist but you mention one broadly outlined group. . What influences exist for students of color in America of American (north, middle, or south) descent? What are their influences? Do they see themselves represented in our profession? Why or why not? . I’m not saying it’s anyone’s fault in our profession currently, we did not create our system, we just exist in it. But when I look around and see so few other than white representations, it definitely makes me think and research and consider why. There’s more at play than cultural influences, although I fully agree that’s one factor."""
Accounting,MasterBates69,t2qswgfpbr,t1kfzgcmi,t1kfyq8u4,01/02/24 10:58,3,2,0,1,"""Why are so few students of color pursuing accounting? Not enough are coming to this profession. Ever stop to really think deeply about why?. People from different cultures grow up around different influences. Those influences impact their major life decisions because that’s just the environment they are around. I don’t get it why it’s so difficult to comprehend that people from different backgrounds simply have different preferences for their career paths. I’m from Indian/south Asian background and there’s surprisingly not a ton of us in accounting. In our community it’s overwhelmingly expected to go into healthcare/engineering/tech and maybe a few other business fields."""
Accounting,irreverentnoodles,t2esdj1yoy,t1kfyq8u4,t1kfxd42t,01/02/24 06:24,2,1,0,1,"""My point exactly. My college was the same, very diverse. accounting is not diverse, majority white and some Asians. Why are so few students of color pursuing accounting? Not enough are coming to this profession. Ever stop to really think deeply about why? . Here’s some light reading. It’s very easy to find this stuff but I guess the majority of accountants are happier to downvote as they’re ’interested in other things.’."""
Accounting,MasterBates69,t2qswgfpbr,t1kfxd42t,t1kfx0ctp,01/01/24 22:04,1,11,0,1,"""My college was diverse as hell (like 60% non-white) and my accounting classes were still mostly all white and Asian people. Theres no racist barrier for other communities to become accountants, they just happen to be interested in other things"""

This book is still for sale on Amazon and is accessible through numerous academic journals. . Flynn renormalizes Asian IQ scores for population gains over time, then concludes that we are basically punching way out of our intellectual weight class professionally. . This calls for thorough scrutiny and demands for removal if found to be unsound, as I have no doubt that this kind of research plays a part in our wholesale disenfranchisement in school and work."

This will give us leverage to yank the racist fucker around like a marionette before cutting him off from any funding institutions with an email campaign. . “It’s just a book” these people will say. But to you and me, we see how our children, and our children’s children will be stuck in this messed up loop of anti-Asian hate if academically-veiled racism like this continues to infect non-Asian folks. It’s time this subreddit gets organized and active on rooting out people like this. They are the same people who shoved our grandparents into curbs during COVID. They are the same people who mock your work ethic despite offering nothing comparable from themselves. They are the same people who will do what they did to German-American and Muslim-American diaspora when geopolitical tensions boil over. I sincerely think that r/AsianAmerican is the best chance for organizing the AAPI community due to the volume of daily activity, and the types of discussions that have popped up since 2020. A lot of other Asian American themed subreddits are either borderline toxic Asian dudes who are sad about dating prospects, or wholesome congregations of food pics etc. . Mods, please help us be more cohesive. Or at least open up some mod slots for those willing to pursue this cohesion. Fighting against racism on the street is where mass movements like #StopAAPIHate can work, but when it comes to subtly racist academics, discussion-based communities like ours could be perfect for warding them off"""

You cant wear any kind of clothes.  If you still put on some clothes its instantly become dust.  You cant use blankets either.Basicly you cant cover yourself with anything. Laws will still apply to you and you will be charged if you walk around naked in the streets."

The funny thing about Christianity is that its supposed to be applied to everyone, whether they believe it or not.  Therefore, my beliefs dont actually matter when discussing it. . And Im not distorting his message at all.  He wanted everyone who accepted him as the savior to be able to get to heaven, otherwise he would not have died upon the cross.  He wanted people to help each other, correct?  So would this not fall under that?  . And again, if the only thing that is stopping you from making the decision to help the less fortunate people of the world is that you wouldnt be able to attend your regular sunday mass, then Im just going to say thats not very Christian.  Theres no reason to not, especially since you already admitted that you dont actually have to attend mass in a church."""
hypotheticalsituation,CryptoSlovakian,t2a2ey89at,t1kg00zd8,t1kfzyh7n,01/02/24 12:22,8,1,0,1,"""Right, but how are you going to lecture me on how I should serve Christ if you don’t even know who he is, and the way you are distorting his message and mission suggests that you don’t. I just want to be sure I haven’t made a rash judgment against you by assuming that."""

hypotheticalsituation,mitochondriarethepow,t22ubormw,t1kfzvcqd,t1kfzuqr2,01/02/24 12:05,5,1,0,1,"""He didnt need fat stacks of cash because he was a miracle worker. . Unless you can create food from nothing, or duplicate it easily, youre going to need money to feed the poor. . Youre not Jesus, youre cryptoslovakian, just some smuck stuck living in this world that requires money to accomplish things. It would be all well and good to not need money to accomplish things, but thats not the reality we live in.   Therefore, foregoing the chance to be able to affect actual long lasting food in this world for a minor inconvenience is so anti-christian that its hilarious."""
hypotheticalsituation,CryptoSlovakian,t2a2ey89at,t1kfzuqr2,t1kfzseha,01/02/24 11:48,4,0,0,1,"""Right, I forgot the part in the Bible about how Jesus helped people with fat stacks of cash."""
hypotheticalsituation,mitochondriarethepow,t22ubormw,t1kfzseha,t1kfxtcu3,01/02/24 11:45,3,1,0,1,"""Because with infinite money you could do more to help your religion and the people suffering in the world for a very minor inconvenience of having to procure a few special ways to worship your diety. . In fact, not taking the money to help the less fortunate shows that youre not actually willing to help them, making you actually less Christian. . Jesus died for everyone and you cant suffer the minor inconvenience of not being able to go to a church when doing so would allow you to provide enrichment for all the worlds poor, homeless, infirm, and suffering peoples."""
hypotheticalsituation,CryptoSlovakian,t2a2ey89at,t1kfxtcu3,t1kfxrswu,01/02/24 00:05,2,0,0,1,"""Why would you be sad about that? It’s sad to me that you would scoff at someone for desiring to lead a virtuous life more than desiring personal wealth, and I fail to see how my devotion to the teachings of Jesus Christ and the Catholic Church harms you or anyone else. I don’t even want any of the things that infinite wealth could buy. I don’t want a ridiculous mansion or dozens of expensive cars. I’d be happy if my student loans and mortgage were paid off."""

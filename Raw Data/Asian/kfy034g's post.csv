A single friend (34f) and I (34f) have online dating apps looking to meet single men between ages 27-45. The dating apps are hit or miss… and having come across (attractive) people we know in real life, we know the apps don’t always do the person justice. So, we want to intentionally go out to meet men in the dating scene in real life. As men, what would you recommend would be good places for this to occur? We’re contemplating Home Depot/Lowes, breweries, joining co-ed sports teams, we’re pretty much open to any idea. Thank you for the suggestions!"

Sure I’ve been rejected before but that’s part of the process. For some people race might be deal breaker but in today’s day and age I think inter racial dating is super common across all demographics."""

As mentioned, as a man approaching 40 I am so so tired specifically, as an Asian man. I am so tired of women not being interested because I’m Asian. Yeah I know the younger crowd is less affected by this, but not me my experience it’s very similar to guys my age and older. The only women who, match with me are Asian women, and they are very few and far between. In person, I go to the gym, I like golf and rock climbing and ride my bike. Since I am Asian people think I am closer to 30 but I’m close to 40. . A couple times women have been very friendly, and it seemed like I could have talked further in real life, but they seemed quite a bit younger, and because of all of the above, the horrible dating experiences over the years, it’s hard not to be tired. . While I am in good shape and make pretty good money, I don’t have style and I’m not good with the ladies. I’m awkward. . So, instead, I focus on making even more money, my goal is to get very fit this year, and look towards retirement. I’ve spent my whole life thinking  my friends are stupid to focus on their looks and style and talking with women when we were young. But I am the fool I may have more money than them, but I am alone."""

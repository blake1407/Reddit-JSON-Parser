I also have been surprised at the boom in boba and ramen places in Memphis too (they even have a place in the Wolfchase Mall now, but Changs in Cordova closed while we were gone apparently). The population Im most familiar with (Cambodian Americans) were scattered in Memphis, its suburbs, and farther off towns and cities in nearby Mississippi (Whitehaven mainly). The Asian people I knew were scattered around Cordova and Bartlett."""

I have gone back a few (maybe 3) times, with the most recent time being November 2021. I was shocked to see that they had boba and ramen places. I agree with most everything you said, though you only mentioned Black people in terms of dating and desire in relation to Asian people as opposed to the fact that Memphis is 66% Black American and thus is much more culturally diverse of an urban population than a lot of other Southern US cities. This, in turn, impacts daily life and experience depending on which area of Memphis you live i.e. do you actually live in Memphis or do you live in a White flight zone (Germantown, Wolfchase, Collierville etc.). A lot of the Asian people I knew lived either downtown midtown/ medical district. Im not sure where most of the Asian people live in Memphis, but there are far more Asian folks in Memphis (and other Southern US cities) than there are in the rural areas. . I want to reiterate the points that I agree with: The US South is welcoming, talkative and chatty. Things move slower. People are still going to be racist, prejudiced, whatever you like to call it, but itll be more in your face vs what happens in non Southern areas, where people smile in your face and stab you in the back. Of course, both types of prejudice/ racism happen in all regions, but thats the general course of matters. . Youll definitely need a car."""

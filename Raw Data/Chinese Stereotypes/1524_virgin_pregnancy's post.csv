According to Greek legend, the virgin Artemis (known as Diana in Italian culture) met the Golden Rain (Figure 15.2.2-4) and became pregnant with the child of her father, Zeus. Whats going on? It is true and not incestuous, for the child, the seven-color deer Buddha (i.e., Adam), is Actaeon who will be essentially changed after his fall into hell and is named Hephaestus based on the change in mutant nature (i.e., sum of annoyance and know). Zeus has been secretly training the Golden Boy (Actaeon) since he was born, and so is the de facto father of the Golden Boy. Illustration 2 is a similar story of the God of the Mexican Codex, Turquoise Prince (also known as the Huitzilopochtli), secretly doing his dirty works like Zeus on his godson, Mexico. At this point, Zeus is happy to discover that Actaeon has been wounded by Artemis 500 Majesties 108,000 Charms seriously and is on the verge of an outbreak of latent psychosis, that he is on the verge of descending into hell (i.e., suffering from psychosis) and becoming Hephaestus, so is really going to be a godfather himself, therefore very happy. . . As for the virgin Artemis (Diana), she was betrothed to Actaeon when she was about one year old. And afterwards Zeus used to ask friends and relatives to come and inquire of her about her fiancé, so that Artemis always remembered her betrothal to Actaeon. This ability to remember before the age of three is known in Buddhism as Fate Through. Readers should know that Artemis has “fate through” throughout her life. She then followed her father Zeus and became a member of the Olympian Movement. When she was about six years old and attending the centralized Amazonian training camp, she vowed to become the goddess Athena (i.e., Eve). Artemis was told that her fiancé, Actaeon, who was also a member of the Olympian Movement, would be going to Hell to fetch the ""Covenant Ark"" and would be suffering from many illnesses, she vowed to take care of him for the rest of his life. Previously, she stole (or crushed) Actaeons heart in their blind date, which was the reason Actaeon fell into Hell and became the Seven-Color Deer Buddha, so she is Actaeons de facto godmother. The ancient Greeks use a vase (shown in Figure 1) to represent the womb of the goddess Artemis (Diana), the goddesss juristic boundary. Chinese Buddhism, Ancient Egyptian culture, and Ancient Mexican culture did the same thing by using a vase to represent the womb of the goddess Jade Girl (Eve). Figure 5, for example, is the Chinese Buddhist Guanyin Bodhisattva, who is Allah’s daughter, Kubaba, so the legendary Arabian devil in Figure 3 is her fiancé from her youth, Mount Sumeru during falling into hell period. Figure 6 is the Egyptian Eve, the bottle in her hand, the bottle with a lion on the right represents Adams teachings. The Chinese Buddhist Shakyamuni (i.e., Adam, Mount Sumeru), the Egyptian Adam, and the ancient Mexican Tlaloc all have the fame of Lion King. Figure 7 shows the bottle used by the Chinese people of Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, and Tibet to draw lots when choosing a golden boy. Since the ""Philosopher-Stone Pestle"" they use is derived from Zeus, the author suggests that their method of choosing a golden boy is derived from Zeus use of Pandoras Box (which is a bottle) to choose a golden boy. The reader should know that Zeus use of Pandoras Magical Bottle (see Section 15.2.2) is only a formality, that Zeus made his decision through a great deal of study, cultivation, and observation. What is the golden rain in Figure 4? It is the gray of the evening when the two of them met earlier, the default empty color of the unconscious (anciently known as God-sense). That gray color gave Artemis (Diana), who resembled the appearance of a goddess, the juristic power of a goddess. When the two of them married, they became Mount Ararats, the Bodhisattvas of the Tenth Land, who would rain great juristic rain, which is the teaching of the Deer Vehicle Religion. This teaching is the ""Mana”, the food given by God, which has the function of circumcision and baptism, which can pull out the three poisonous arrows of greed, irritability, and ignorance. This teaching utilizes in many places the principle that ""the pre-consciousness stops when it encounters emptiness,"" and that ""immaculate senses (i.e., empty senses) harm have,"" which is why the ancient Greeks likened the gray of that sunset to a rain of gold. Even though Artemis (Diana) was really Actaeons godmother, why did Zeus need to create the ""virgin pregnancy"" bizarre anecdote? This was because Zeus wanted his daughter Artemis to remember Actaeon and cultivate her feelings for Actaeon. According to Greek legend, 500 years later, when Hephaestus (i.e. middle-aged Actaeon) came back from hell, Aphrodite (Venus, middle-aged Diana) saw him and recognized him as her fiancé and godson. These 500 years are converted from Catastrophe. Hephaestus is a cripple, and the concept of lameness is the definition of the Catastrophe or Catastrophic Calendar. In ancient cultures, the Catastrophe of the golden boy falling into hell was generally converted into 500 solar calendar years. Only Islam converted the hell catastrophe of Mount Sumeru into 300 years, and it was compiled into the Sumerian King List. Also, the previous article Cronus praised his son Zeus as the ""umbilical cord of the world"" (meaning the Creator). In this article, the ""virgin pregnancy"" is Zeus nourishing the future earth of Greece (i.e., Athena, Gaia, the earth mother) as it grows. ↪Back to Catalog of Chapter 15 Salvation Crux"

China,RandomIdiot918,t2_l74d4k34,t3_1e5clcf,,07/17/24 03:59,0,0,0.5,25,"""5 days ago i returned from a 2 week trip in 3 cities. WARNING:LONG POST. TL;DR: China very cool. Wanted to share my experience, traveling through Beijing (3-4 days), Xian (2-3 days) and Lanzhou (1 week). This trip was a program made by Northwest Normal University, so all we had to pay was for plane tickets going from Istanbul to Beijing and back, as well as for the tour guides, totaling at 1500 euro (hotels/entrance tickets/ food was paid). We had to make a visa and some documents for the underage in our group ( i am 15 and white, important later). All around it was a great trip. In beijing we visited The Great Wall at Badaling, where we individually climbed it. I have to say Chinese mountains are crazy, as i never saw such big/cliffy mounts in my life. Also i was pleasantly surprised by the low prices, almost equal to the ones from my country (Moldova). Also in Beijing we went to Beijing zoo, and got to just see/explore/wander around some beautifull places. We took the fast trains from Beijingxi to Xianbei, 5 hours going 350 km/hr (i only went 3 times on some kind of train in my life, and even then it was these old trains going 30-50 km/hr). Xian was better than Beijing. Much more beautifull and less polluted. We went at the Terracotta Army and explored the markets/central square(s) of Xian. Then we spent 1 week in Lanzhou (we got there by train also). We lived in the student dormitories, and got to speak with them in Russian (many of them are from Kyrgyzstan,Turkmenistan,Etc.) There we visited the Zhongshan bridge, Wuchuan Mountain and Lanzhou Museum. . So, some things i liked/disliked. Food: chinese food is VERY spicy/hot. If it is sweet then it is too sweet for my liking. We got to eat many foods, including: ramen noodle soup, baozi, sweet pork, mystery meats (bc i have no ideea what it comes from), LOADS OF RICE, local street foods that i dont know the name of. These are just some of the highlights beacuse, im sorry, but some foods made me cry beacuse i didnt like the texture/it was too spicy. But the drinks at stores/tea is good, especially the Lanzhou milk tea( i love it soo much). Paying/money: They told us that card is accepted anywhere but that is just not true. I also had the problem of not being able to setup mobile paying apps beacuse it wouldnt work. And alipay was hard to install and also had errors. First 2 days i couldnt buy anything but then i got cash from a Bank of China ATM from my card, and the problem was solved. Language: My first language is Romanian so i know they wouldnt know it. But i was surprised at the level of not knowing English among Chinese people. I knew of this thing beforehand but i did not know it was this extreme. But with google translate i resolved the problem. Overall architecture/infrastructure-very good! I like to observe the inftastructure and architecture of any place i visit, and China did not dissapoint. With all the big highways, but also developed/bike-accesible roads and alleyways it made it look very good, and i was surprised that there was no stopping traffic (Even tho Chinese cities are fcking huge, Lanzhou alone is at least twice as big in population as my country). Roads are very good and public transit is accesible and cheap. Also the architecture of old Beijing or any town is very unique. Security: I was surprised at the  level of security going anywhere. Specifically the security checks at train stations/airports (which are more strict than in other places). Also the pure amount of cameras is shocking. Everywhere you go you are being watched , but with such a big population i understamd the need for such a big security. Locals behaviour: By this i mean that chinese people like to photo you a lot. Everywhere there are some people that will whip out their cameras and start to film you if we are in a group (all of us being white/european). Not a big problem, most of them asked us beforehand, and i have some selfies with some people there. Overall experience was more unique than  very cool, and made me realise that China is another world completly, almost isolated and developing in its own way."

CCP and many brainwashed Chinese people believe China is the richest and best country in the world:) my mom makes around 100 per month for many years  until she was too old to work. I told her not to work, but we were that poor and still very poor now, we have to work till death probably. Were I you as a foreigner, I would take advantage of Chinese government. Don’t think about the poor Chinese people, even if you don’t use up our money, the government won’t give the money back to those who really need it for living."""

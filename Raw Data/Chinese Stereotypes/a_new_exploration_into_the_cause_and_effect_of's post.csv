ZhaobaoTaichi,Due_Mastodon_9951,t2_10b9oggb4b,t3_1dxgqc2,,07/07/24 09:38,0,1,1.0,1,"""A New Exploration into the Cause and Effect of the Controversy over the Origin of Tai Chi (Lu Dimin). # xa0The origin of Tai Chi is an important part of the study of Tai Chi history, but there is still no consensus. The disagreement started with Tang Haos textual research. Under what historical background did Tang Hao conduct his textual research? Are his textual research methods and conclusions scientific? I have made some discussions in the two articles ""The Doubtful Thought and Tang Haos Tai Chi Textual Research"" and ""The Extreme Left Thought and Gu Liuxins Tai Chi Research"" (Wudang, Issue 10, 2002 and Issue 7-8, 2005). In recent years, through the study and research of Chinese academic history, I have some new understandings on this. The traditional view of Tai Chis origin and development over the past century Here, I would like to first talk about three historical facts as the premise for studying the origin of Tai Chi. First, in the nearly 100 years before 1926, was the Tai Chi that was popular in Chinese society Yang style Tai Chi? The origin of Chinese Tai Chi is quite early, and it is an indisputable fact that Yang Luchan broke the conservative habits and widely spread Tai Chi from Yongyi to Beijing in the middle of the Qing Dynasty, becoming the pioneer of modern Tai Chi. Of course, the origin of Wu-style and Wu-style Tai Chi is also more than a hundred years old, but Wu-style and Wu-style Tai Chi are related to Yang-style Tai Chi and are branches of Yang-style Tai Chi. It can be said that before the 1930s, the Tai Chi that was circulated in society was all passed down by Yang Luchan, and there was never a school of thought. Although Chen-style Tai Chi also had an early origin, it was not introduced until 1926, which is a fact that Tang Hao and Gu Liuxin do not deny. After the 1930s, due to various reasons, Tai Chi began to have schools of thought. Second, the Yang family has always revered Wudang Zhang Sanfeng as the founder of Tai Chi? From Zhang Sanfeng to Wang Zongyue, Wang Zongyue passed it on to Jiang Fa, Jiang Fa passed it on to Chen Changxing, and Chen Changxing passed it on to Yang Luchan? This statement has been passed down for 170 years? Since Yang Style Tai Chi was spread, the earliest person to record the origin of Tai Chi was Li Yishe (1832-1892), the successor of Wu Style Tai Chi. Because Li Yishe learned from his uncle Wu Yuxiang (1812-1880), who first learned from Yang Luchan (1799-1874) and then went to Zhaobao Town, Henan Province to learn from Chen Qingping, Li Yishes theory also included Yang Luchans theory. In the ""Preface to Tai Chi"" that Li Yishe copied to Ma Yinshu in 1867, he said: ""Tai Chi It started with Zhang Sanfeng in the Song Dynasty. Its subtlety and ingenuity were fully discussed by Wang Zongyue. Later, it was passed down to the Chen family in Chenjiagou, Henan. There were only a few people who were good at it. A certain Yang Lu (note: Yang Luchan) from Nanguan, our county, loved it and went to learn from him. He devoted himself to it for more than ten years and became extremely skilled. ""(See Tang Hao and Gu Liuxin: Taijiquan Research, Peoples Sports Publishing House, 3rd edition, February 1996, page 133) In 1867, Yang Luchan and Wu Yuxiang were still alive, so his statement should be the consensus of Yang and Wu. u3000In 1931, Master Yang Chengfu said in the ""Original Preface to Taijiquan"" of ""The Use of Taijiquan"": ""Taijiquan was passed down from Master Zhang, a native of Yizhou, Liaodong, with the Taoist name Sanfeng, born in the late Song Dynasty. "" In 1934, Master Yang Chengfu said in the ""Preface to the Complete Book of Taijiquan"": ""My great-grandfather further proclaimed that Taijiquan was created by Zhang Sanfeng in the late Song Dynasty?"" ""Master Chen was the only disciple of Mr. Jiang Fa?"" To be more specific, Yang Chengfu said, ""My grandfather said that our ancestor was Zhang Sanfeng, and my grandfathers master was Jiang Fa?"" The works of the descendants and main successors of the Yang family all say this, and it has not changed in the 170 years since Yang Luchan taught Taijiquan? Third, Yang style Tai Chi has no origins in Chen style Tai Chi. Isn  it a reformed and simplified version of ""Chen style old frame""? Is this another way of expressing the above traditional saying? The saying that Yang style Tai Chi was simplified from ""Chen style old frame"" was proposed by Tang Hao in the 1930s, which is inconsistent with the traditional saying of Yang family? The Tai Chi that Yang Luchan passed on was the Tai Chi that Chen Changxing learned from Jiang Fa, and there was no question of reforming and simplifying ""Chen style old frame"", so we need to examine Tang Hao and clearly put forward this conclusion? The records of Zhang Sanfeng creating boxing can be found as early as Huang Zongxis ""Epitaph of Wang Zhengnan"" (1669), ""Boxing Skills School"" in ""Complete Works of Zhang Sanfeng"" and ""Ningbo Prefecture Records? Biography of Zhang Songxi"" (1735). As for the inheritance relationship from Zhang Sanfeng to Wang Zongyue, it is no longer possible to verify it. If it is necessary to have continuous historical records to count, it is unreasonable. There is a saying in the martial arts world that ""one should talk about the ancestor but not the teacher"". Most people in the world don  know who their grandfathers grandfather is. Are they all fake people with no evidence? What I need to emphasize here is that the Yang familys ancestral tradition about the origin of Tai Chi is not a ""viewpoint"" but a direct ""historical material"". ""Historical material"" itself has the nature of ""evidence"". This is what the Yang family said. There is no need to ""verify"" this point. Not only the Yang family, but also Wu style, Wu style, Sun style, and Zhaobao Tai Chi all hold the view that Zhang Sanfeng founded the boxing. These are all facts that do not need to be verified. As for the use of historical materials, it depends on personal opinion. As a descendant of the Yang family, you cannot easily deny the theory that Zhang Sanfeng founded the boxing passed down by the ancestors just because the historical records or the teachers teachings are unclear. Yang Zhenduo, the son of Master Yang Chengfu, said at a meeting in Handan: ""I have not studied the origin of Tai Chi, but our Yang family has always worshipped Zhang Sanfeng."" It is not surprising that there is no research on the origin of Tai Chi. Understanding and adhering to the ancestral tradition is the correct attitude of Tai Chi descendants that cannot be criticized. Of course, it is possible to conduct a reasonable analysis of traditional statements from an academic perspective, but academic research must also have a correct attitude and scientific methods? Lets see if Tang Haos denial of traditional statements is really reasonable? This question has to start with the skeptical trend of thought in the modern New Culture Movement. The trend of doubting antiquity is related to Japans idea of invading China Chinas New Culture Movement in the early 20th century held high the banner of ""democracy"" and ""science"", opposed the old ethics, old morality, and old culture, and put forward the slogan of ""overthrowing the Confucian shop"". This was a liquidation of the feudal ruling ideology for thousands of years and had far-reaching significance. However, along with the hatred of the feudal dynasty and feudal culture, the Chinese academic community developed an extreme emotion and led to a doubtful trend of thought that completely denied Chinas traditional culture. The anti-feudal significance of the doubtful trend of thought can be affirmed, but its negative effects - the denial of the early history of the Chinese nation, the denial of the cultural heritage accumulated by the Chinese people for thousands of years, and the damage to the national spirit and national self-esteem cannot be ignored. The research of the historical community also found that the doubtful trend of thought was related to Japans invasion of China, and it was in line with Japans ideological and political invasion of China. Since modern times, the dominant ideology in Japanese society has been ""leaving Asia and joining Europe"", advocating the theory of Japanese superiority. As early as 1885, Fukuzawa Yoshihide published ""Leaving Asia Theory"", which aimed to make Japan a ""Western country in the East"" and promote the invasion of Asia by Western powers in Asia as an Asian country. He despised and belittled China and Korea, creating public opinion for aggression and expansion. Shiratori Kurakichi, who is known as the founder of Japans ""Oriental History"", wrote a series of articles denying ancient Chinese history with his student Hashimoto Masukichi since 1909, proposing the ""Eliminating the Yao, Shun and Yu Theory"", saying that The legends of Yao, Shun and Yu in ancient Chinese books are all myths, which are the ideals of Confucianism, and the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors are worshipped by Taoism? It not only reflects his personal tendency to despise Chinese history, but also reflects the strong sense of superiority of the victorious country in Japanese society, which is an important part of Japans expansion and aggression public opinion? Later, Shiratori Kurakichi personally participated in planning Doiharas ""Manchukuo"" movement, which is a clear evidence of his early efforts to create public opinion for the invasion of China? Although his arguments were refuted by Hayashi Taisuke, Goto Taro and others, Shiratori Kurakichis great influence made the suspicion of Yao, Shun and Yu a trend in Japanese academic circles? Chinas antiquity skepticism also denies the ancient history of Yao, Shun, and Yu and those before them. Does this have anything to do with Shiratori Kujis ""erasure of Yao, Shun, and Yu"" theory? Yes! As representatives of the antiquity skepticism movement (also known as the ""ancient history debate"" movement), Qian Xuantong and Gu Jiegang are both likely to have been influenced by Shiratori Kuji. Some have verified that Qian Xuantong basically spent time in Japan from 1905 to 1910, and it is entirely possible that he had seen Shiratori Kujis articles. After returning to China, he put forward a series of radical arguments and wrote an article in ""New Youth"", arguing that ""the most thorough way to abolish Confucianism and Taoism is to put all Chinese books on the shelf"", and advocated the abolition of Chinese characters? Then he followed Shiratoris words and said, ""Yao and Shun were created by the Zhou people imagining the situation before the flood?"" ""And I think there is no such thing as classics at all?"" ""Xu Shens ""Shuowen Jiezi"" ""The Book of Ancient Chinese History"" is a collection of pseudo-ancient characters, pseudo-ancient meanings, pseudo-ancient rituals, pseudo-ancient systems and pseudo-ancient theories. ""If Yao, Shun and Yu are not credible, then the Confucians who always mention Yao and Shun and the Taoists who rely on the Book of Changes will fall. Qian Xuantong is a professor at Peking University. Gu Jiegang was influenced by Qian Xuantong when he was studying at Peking University. As Gu Jiegang said: ""My guiding ideology of ancient history criticism originated from the thoughts of Zheng, Yao and Cui in the distant past, and was inspired and helped by Hu Shi and Qian Xuantong in the recent past."" Although Gu Jiegang did not go to Japan, he worked as a ""cataloger"" in the Peking University Library from 1920 to 1922, checked foreign books, and had the opportunity to see Japanese publications criticizing Chinese ancient history (after investigation, the Peking University Library has these Japanese publications)? Therefore, the connection between the doubting of ancient history and the Japanese invasion of China does exist? As early as the 1930s, Lu Shixian said in ""Shiji Huizhu Kaozheng Fuyi"": ""Gus disbelief in the ""Yaodian"" and the theories of Xia Yu was Shiratoris preface."" Xu Xusheng also said in ""The Legendary Era of Ancient Chinese History"" (1960, Science Press): ""The Japanese court scholars advocated the argument of obliterating Yao, Shun and Yu. They had their own hidden motives for facilitating aggression, and it was not a scientific achievement.  The extreme scholars of the ancient doubt school were directly or indirectly, intentionally or unintentionally contaminated by the poison of the imperialist court scholars, and wrote off the history before Xia Qi."" Hu Qiuyuans ""Outline of Chinese Ideological History in the Past 130 Years"" (1973, Taipei, Xuelin Press) further pointed out that the ""initiator of the ancient doubt movement was Qian Xuantong"", and Qian Xuantong was ""learning from Shiratoris tongue"", and Gu Jiegang became the leader of the ancient doubt movement under the inspiration of Qian Xuantong? These views are all reasonable and well-founded? Wang Guowei, a famous Chinese scholar, wrote in a letter to Luo Zhenyu: ""Gu Jiegang (also an assistant teacher) has also come and is also very hardworking, but his style is similar to that of Japanese scholars of literature. This is also a natural result."" This may mean that Gu Jiegangs doubt about ancient things is similar to that of Shiratori Kuji in Japan, but Wang Guowei does not support this doubt about ancient things? Of course, modern scholars who doubt ancient history are also influenced by ancient Chinese skepticism. Their response to Japanese thought was not to promote Japans anti-China sentiment, but in fact they did what the invaders wanted to do but could not do. The Japanese invaders iron hoof made these masters who doubt ancient history understand who they were helping. Mr. Qian Mu said in ""Miscellaneous Memories of Teachers and Friends"" that during the Anti-Japanese War, ""Qian Xuantong sighed that he had lost his way in his academic research on his deathbed before his death"", and Gu Jiegang ""never mentioned the questions raised in his long-renowned book ""Ancient History Criticism"" again. And? There is actually an intention to find a new way and start anew? Liao Mingchun commented: ""Qian Xuantongs sigh of losing his way in academic research and Gu Jiegangs intention to find a new way and start anew are reflections on his early years of doubting the ancients under the cruel situation of the Anti-Japanese War, and may also include his self-blame for accepting Shiratori Kujis  heory of erasing Yao, Shun and Yu in his early years?"" (For details, see Liao Mingchuns ""New Evidence of Chinese Academic History"" ""On the Ideological Sources of the Rise of the Ancient History Criticism Movement"", Sichuan University Press, 2005, pp. 155-177) Tang Haos research brings trouble upon himself I once said that Tang Haos research on Taijiquan was a reflection of the skepticism of antiquity in the martial arts field in the early 20th century. This is not only because Tang Haos approach to denying Chinese traditional culture is similar to that of the skepticism of antiquity, but also because his thinking method is the same as that of the representatives of the skepticism of antiquity. Was Tang Haos denial of the early history of Taijiquan also influenced by the Japanese invasion of China? I cannot make arbitrary judgments. But it just so happens that Tang Hao went to Japan to study politics and law in 1927, returned to China in 1928 and served as the director of the editing department of the Central Guoshu Museum. In 1930, he published ""Shaolin and Wudang Research"", saying that the early history of Shaolin and Wudang was all fabricated. This cannot rule out that he was influenced by Japanese thought. At least objectively, he played the same role as the skepticism of antiquity scholars in damaging national self-esteem. u3000u3000The publication of ""Shaolin Wudang Research"" cannot really be called ""research"", because he adheres to the principle of ""doubt first and then research"" of the ancient skepticism school. Without any evidence and without visiting Chenjiagou, he concluded that Zhang Sanfeng was definitely not the ancestor of Tai Chi, and denounced the records since Huang Zongxi and the statements of various schools as ""evil words to confuse the public"". This will certainly arouse peoples anger. u3000u3000Gu Liuxin said in ""Remembering Tang Hao"": ""Most of the books published at that time, such as illustrated Tai Chi, held the view that Tai Chi was passed down by immortals. In this way, Tang Hao offended the authors of these books, and also offended some professional boxers who thought they were authentic Shaolin and Wudang masters who were brave enough to fight privately. They planned to beat Tang Hao with all means."" After Zhu Guofu and Wang Ziping mediated, Tang Hao was not beaten. Of course, he could not stay in the National Martial Arts Museum. Gu Liuxin said: ""Soon, Tang Hao left Nanjing and returned to Shanghai to practice law. Later, when Tang Hao mentioned this incident to me, he said: Fortunately, these two old friends mediated and avoided an unexpected disaster."" In Gu Liuxins view, Tang Hao was a hero who was in danger of an unexpected disaster for upholding the truth. If you look at it from another angle, isn  this the bitter fruit of hurting the national spirit and national self-esteem? u3000u3000Of course, even if Tang Hao was influenced by Japanese thoughts, it was unintentional. He also served as a defense lawyer for anti-Japanese activists during the Anti-Japanese War. Some boxing friends called Tang Hao a ""traitor"", but thats not necessary. We can  treat Tang Hao the same way as Tang Hao did. u3000u3000No evidence or no evidence u3000u3000Tang Hao and Gu Liuxins research on the origin of Taijiquan can be summarized into three aspects: first, the denial of the theory that Zhang Sanfeng created the boxing; second, the affirmation of the theory that Chen Wangting created the boxing; third, the various excuses they made to justify their own theories, including including all schools of Taijiquan into the origin of Chens school, removing the traces of Zhang Sanfeng from the Taijiquan classics and boxing theories, etc. Their conclusions are so surprising that they are rare in the history of Chinese academics. The Chen family did not create Taijiquan, but Tang Hao gave them the title of ""creating Taijiquan"". Yang, Wu, Wu, Sun, and Zhaobao Taijiquan all hold the theory that Zhang Sanfeng created the boxing, but Tang Hao imposed another ancestor on them. There have been many refutations in the Taijiquan community about this, and here we will focus on analyzing it from the perspectives of ideological methods and social background. u3000u3000Gu Liuxin said that Tang Hao ""used a lot of historical data to prove that Bodhidharma and Zhang Sanfeng did not know martial arts, and pointed out that the so-called Shaolin boxing originated from the Indian monk Bodhidharma and Taijiquan originated from Wudang Zhang Sanfeng were all far-fetched by later generations."" The author has not seen Tang Haos ""Shaolin and Wudang Research"" (1930), but Tang Haos ""The Origin of Taijiquan"" (1935) and Tang Hao and Gu Liuxins ""Taijiquan Research"" (1964) should be works that further comprehensively reflect their achievements. The author cannot find ""a lot of historical data"" that denies Zhang Sanfeng. The full criticism of Tang Hao in ""The Origin of Taijiquan"" is: u3000u3000""Taijiquan is the most popular in society today. Most bored boxers follow Wang Zongyue, who wrote the Taijiquan Classic, and blindly attribute it to Zhang Sanfeng, who was skilled in martial arts after a dream. Jiang Rongqiao, a so-called Taijiquan master who claims to be a disciple of the sword fairy, even fabricated Zhang Sanfeng in his Taijiquan lecture that he was a monster who was resurrected from the grave and declared that he would watch the Han people recover their territory. We can  ignore the ideological poison just because those who are influenced by him are only a part of those who love martial arts, and then listen to his evil words to confuse the public."" u3000u3000""A boring boxer""? ""Fabricated""? ""Monster""? ""Poisoned""? ""Misleading the public with lies"", is this Tang Haos evidence? Taijiquan descendants of various schools respect Wang Zongyues works, why is he a ""boring boxer""? Wang Zongyues boxing classics have Zhang Sanfengs name in many versions, why must it be ""fabricated""? The ""Biography of Mr. Zhang Sanfeng, the founder of Taiji"" in Jiang Rongqiaos work is a combination of Huang Zongxis ""Epitaph of Wang Zhengnan"", ""Ming History? Biography of Zhang Sanfeng"", ""Taiyuan County Chronicles"" and other historical materials, which are well documented, why is it ""fabricated""? Obviously, the ""large amount of historical materials"" that Tang Hao ""examined"" are nothing more than a large number of unfounded charges? u3000u3000Gu Liuxin said in ""Taijiquan Research"": u3000u3000""There was a theory about the origin of Taijiquan that it started in the late Yuan Dynasty and early Ming Dynasty and the Tang Dynasty. But if we examine the historical facts, it is obvious that it is a fabrication."" ""According to the History of Ming Dynasty and the Records of Taihe Mountain, which have been compiled and revised, there is no mention of Zhang Sanfeng knowing boxing. Even in the manuscript of Sanfeng Complete Works compiled by Wang Xiling, a monk from Yuantong who lived in Sichuan in 1723 and the Sanfeng Complete Works revised and published by Li Hanxu, a monk from Changyi Mountain in 1844, although they all lied and claimed to have seen Zhang Sanfeng in the 14th century, they never fabricated that Zhang Sanfeng knew boxing or created Taijiquan."" u3000u3000Here, the ""historical facts"" of ""falsely claiming to be true"" are the ""Ming History""? Neither the ""Taihe Mountain Records"" nor the ""Complete Works of Sanfeng"" record that Zhang Sanfeng knew boxing? Not to mention that there is also an article ""Boxing Skills School"" in the ""Complete Works of Zhang Sanfeng"" that records that Zhang Sanfeng created boxing, but Gu Liuxin did not find it. Tang Hao and Gu Liuxin both ignored the records of Zhang Sanfengs creation of boxing in Huang Zongxis ""Epitaph of Wang Zhengnan"" and ""Ningbo Prefecture Records"", and even regarded the traditional statements of the Yang family as rumors? This method of using the ox head to deny the horses mouth is the same as the ""silent proof method"" commonly used by the ancient doubters in the past? The so-called ""silent proof method"" is quite cumbersome in its description. One of its meanings is that if a person in a certain era or a certain book does not record something, then what is recorded by others in other books is false? The ""Methods of Distinguishing Forged Books and Verifying the Age"" by Liang Qichao, a giant of Chinese studies, listed 13 standards for distinguishing forgeries, which had a great influence? The first one is ""see if it is recorded in the old records"". He attributed the authenticity of a book to whether it is recorded in a certain record book, whether a certain person knows it, whether the number of volumes is the same as that of the old book, etc. This is based on a wrong premise, that is, a certain record book must contain all the books, and a certain person must have read all the books in the world. This is not logically rigorous, and thus has caused a large number of false cases. For example, he believes that books before the Western Han Dynasty that are not recorded in the ""Han Ji"" are all fake books. From the materials unearthed in recent years, it can be seen that many pre-Qin books are not recorded in the ""Han Ji"", and those that have been considered fake books in the old notes have also been proven to be true. In the entire movement of doubting the ancients, the abuse of silent verification is a common phenomenon. Tang Hao and Gu Liuxin believe that the traditional sayings about the origin of Tai Chi ""have no real evidence"", which is actually a manifestation of ""ignoring real evidence"". The saying of ""a lot of historical materials"" is pure bluffing. u3000u3000Night Dreams of Emperor Xuan and Honoring Immortality u3000u3000Tang Hao described Zhang Sanfeng as a ""monster"" who ""became proficient in martial arts through a dream"", and Gu Liuxin also said that ""Huang Zongxi did not examine the absurdity of Zhang Sanfengs dream that Emperor Xuan taught him boxing"", and called the traditional saying of the origin of Tai Chi ""absurd immortal legend""? This is consistent with the thinking methods and means of scholars who doubt ancient history? ""Attack one point and ignore the rest"" is the method, and ""connect with politics and exert pressure"" is the means? At present, some people who deny that Zhang Sanfeng created boxing think that they have mastered an invincible weapon just by grasping the sentence ""I dreamed that Emperor Xuan taught me boxing"" and know nothing else? If the textual research work is so simple, what kind of textual research is it? ""Historical Records"" records that the ancestor of the Shang Dynasty (Qi) was pregnant by his mother eating bird eggs, and the ancestor of the Zhou Dynasty (Qi) was pregnant by his mother stepping on the footprints of giants? Can this absurd statement be used to deny the existence of the Shang and Zhou dynasties and the historical value of ""Historical Records""? u3000u3000Extreme scholars who doubt ancient history have gone beyond the track of academic research and are now serving their political purposes. As Mr. Liao Mingchun said, ""By putting all Chinese books on the shelf, the goal of abolishing Confucianism and destroying Taoism is achieved. This is the true spirit of the ancient history criticism movement."" Isn  Tang Haos Tai Chi textual research based on the premise of ""destroying Buddhism and Taoism""? Under the banner of opposing feudal superstition, all historical materials related to Buddhism and Taoism are not sufficient as evidence. This is Tang Haos important magic weapon for textual research? u3000u3000After Tang Haos death, Gu Liuxin, in an era when extreme leftist ideas were gradually gaining popularity, ""being proud of passing on the immortal teachings"" became a political stick, and mentioning Zhang Sanfeng again became a crime? Gu Liuxin said in his 1964 article ""Starting from the Problem of Chansi Jin"": u3000u3000""Nowadays, few people dare to take pride in being passed down by immortals, but Mr. Xu Zhiyi, in the appendix of ""Wang Zongyues Tai Chi Boxing Theory"" to ""Wu Style Tai Chi Boxing"", could not bear to part with it and kept the following: Original note: This is the posthumous theory of Master Zhang Sanfeng from Wudang Mountain? Is Mr. Xu still nostalgic for the legend that Zhang Sanfeng created Tai Chi Boxing? Why did he let the ghost of Zhang Sanfeng appear?"" u3000u3000Tang Haos ""Research on Wang Zongyues Taijiquan Classics"" collected 14 Taijiquan classics for comparison, 10 of which had the words ""this is the legacy of Master Zhang Sanfeng of Wudang Mountain"" (including the ""factory version"" boxing classics discovered by Tang Hao). Whats wrong with Xu Zhiyi keeping the original appearance? If this is also called ""academic debate"", can China still have academics? Even the ""Sports Daily"" at the time refused to publish this article, and Gu Liuxins son Gu Yuanzhuang sorted it out and published it in ""Shanghai Wushu"" Issue 3, 2003 (""Wuhun"" magazine 2004 Issue 2-3 reprinted it continuously). Unfortunately, in todays era, the stick of ""honoring the immortals inheritance"" has become rotten and useless? u3000u3000The author believes that it is reasonable to say that Bodhidharma is not the inventor of Shaolin Kung Fu, both in terms of facts and reason, and it does not undermine the dignity of the Chinese people. It is also not true that Zhang Sanfeng is not the founder of Tai Chi. Zhang Sanfeng is indeed an elusive and mysterious figure, but from a large number of records, it can be seen that he is indeed a famous Taoist priest with Taoism, works, relics, and descendants. He is not a ""mythical"" immortal, but a ""deified"" real person. Taoism is a native religion in China. The translation and circulation of Laozis ""Tao Te Ching"" in the world are second only to the ""Bible"". This is the pride of the Chinese people. Tai Chis characteristics of valuing gentleness and the principle of self-sacrifice and following others can be said to be a living version of the ""Tao Te Ching"", and its relationship with Taoist immortal studies is also natural. British Dr. Joseph Needham also said in his masterpiece ""History of Science and Technology in China"" that Zhang Sanfengs name is associated with Tai Chi. Why can  we admit it ourselves?  u3000u3000It is not easy to create something out of nothing u3000u3000Tang Hao and Gu Liuxins denial of Zhang Sanfengs creation of the martial arts is groundless and based on bullying. It is hard to convince the public. Their affirmation of Chen Wangtings creation of the martial arts and the various excuses they made to justify their own theories are far-fetched, full of loopholes, and even fabricated at will. For example, they said that Chen Sens ""marginal notes"" for the ""Chen Family Tree"" in the 1920s were ""the most credible historical data in the 19th year of Qianlong"", and said that the five sets of Paochu (only one set is also called Thirteen Postures) in Chens ""Liang Yi Tang Ben"" were five sets of ""Thirteen Postures"" or five sets of ""Tai Chi"". In order to include Zhaobao Yang Style Tai Chi into the Chen Style, Tang Hao and Gu Liuxin fabricated the saying that ""Chen Qingping married into Zhaobao Town"" and gave Yang Wangting the title of ""Tai Chi"". Luchan was given the title of ""reform and simplify the old Chen style""? What is even more intolerable is that they ignored the fact that Yang Luchan had three sons before he was 40 years old, and fabricated that Yang Luchan ""sold himself as a servant at the age of ten for 30 years"", and returned to Yongnian still ""alone""? In order to explain the difference between Yang style Tai Chi and Chen style Tai Chi, they said that Yang Luchan ""was illiterate"" and changed the pronunciation of ""lazy tie clothes"" to ""lanquewei""? A person who has been in Chenjiagou for 30 years (according to Tang Haos statement), even if he is illiterate, can  distinguish between ""lazy tie clothes"" and ""lanquewei""? (For details, please see my works ""Doubtful Thoughts and Tang Haos Tai Chi Research"" and ""Ultra-left Thoughts and Gu Liuxins Tai Chi Research"") u3000u3000Imagine, to give the Chen family, which mainly practices Paochu, the title of ""inventing Taijiquan"", and to include other schools that have nothing to do with it, how easy is it to create something out of nothing! There is no other way except to make it up? The author believes that the legends and records of Zhang Sanfengs creation of boxing are accurate, but the information is not detailed. From a strict academic perspective, it is a situation that cannot be fully confirmed or categorically denied. Many historical records are like this? But Tang Haos theory that Chen Wangting created boxing and his defense are absolutely untenable? His arguments are far-fetched and right and wrong are reversed. There is no ""academic"" flavor anymore? If Tang Hao was influenced by Japanese thought or Chinese doubt about ancient thought when he published ""Shaolin Wudang Research"" at the Central Guoshu Museum, he was ""doubting before researching"", then after he almost ""suffered from old boxing"" and had to leave the Central Guoshu Museum, his motivation for ""researching"" changed. I am afraid that it was out of personal grudges. In order to save face, ""creating something out of nothing"" became the actual purpose? u3000u3000Of course, my criticism of Tang Hao and Gu Liuxin is mainly about the research on the origin of Tai Chi. As for their research on other aspects of Chinese martial arts history, I dare not make any rash comments. I have no objection to calling Tang Hao a pioneer in Chinese martial arts history. However, the history of Chinese martial arts, especially the history of Tai Chi, cannot remain in the pioneering stage where the skeptical thought is prevalent!"

I love procrastination, so I will be explaining names of HSR characters from the chinese perspective, as names usually has deeper meanings in China/Japan or related to elements shown on their drip marketing, lore, cut scenes, etc. Some of their names also has influence from other cultures like Acheron herself, coming also from greek. (Disclaimer: I have not played HI3 so I might miss some nuances as characters share traits and story across multiverse? Take this just as curiosities I´ve spotted on).    -. # THIS CONTAINS SPOLERS. Notes:. - /words between slashes are the official transcription to alphabet or how it is pronounced/. - (between parenthesys is my explanation, or detailing things). - hanji (chinese)/kanji (japanese) are the same, the only variations is how japanese and chinese people refer to them.    -. Raiden ""Acheron"" Bosenmori Mei a.k.a.  """"  . Raiden, represented with the following hanji  /Léi diàn/ means thunder or thunder lightning if you may. This is a trait shared with all her alter ego, Raiden Mei or Raiden Ei, belonging to the electrical element with a katana as weapon, as you guys know. Acheron or  /Huáng quán/, is where we go after death. We could pretty much assure this is the underwold or hell depending on the culture. In chinese culture, this is a (water) spring, not the season. It literally means, yellow spring. There´s 9 hell circles and a spring in each, a total of 9 springs, and Huanquan is one of them. This might explain why does she need IX debuff in order to ult, apart of the fact she´s a IX follower. >In greek mythology  Ἀχέρων is a river in the infernal regions; also, the infernal regions themselves.  Pre-Greek but folk-etymologically said to be from ἄχος (ákhos, “pain, distress”) +u200e ῥέον (rhéon, “stream”). This serves for her as Nickname as she travels throught the universe, while hiding her name. This lead us to explain Bosenmori,  /Wàng chuān shǒu/. If we break it down to parts, we get:. : forget, forgotten. : this one is a little bit tricky. If we use it as it is, normally we refer it to river separating two ways of the river. It can also refer to  which is simply a plain, a vast land that´s all acorss (I´ve never heard of this explanation tho, but doing researches it came along. So I guess Hoyo is playing with both meanings as her ult cast a vast plain field of water and slice them down, or maybe is just me fantasazing a lot). : defend/er, protector. (Is she protecting the balance of the world? Killing if needed as long as she can achieve a greater goal for the sake of the universe, being the companion of dead ppl so they don´t alter the natural order of things). Thus, we get defender of the forgotten river, bc the all of the hanji above can work as subject or adjetive, but it´s like english, normally we use adjetives before the subject, so forget and river becomes adjetives aiming to protector (for example, Red dotted beatle, even thought beatle is a clear case of subject, but I hope I´m explaining myself xD). Mei pronuntiation is traight foward coming from japanese  /Yá yī/ in chinese. : sprout or bud. : clothes. (wtf???). However I believe there´s a little more behind it. So, normally names has stylization behid translation and transcription. From  we can get some sort of reborn or even growth. She had to leave Izumo cause she did some thing, right? Then, reborn and grow as a new person. But I´m missing the clothes part, bc if it was about aesthetics, they could have use other idiograms with prettier meanings, like  which is art, and there´s absolute no reference about her changing dresses or anyhting in the story.  I´d say it´s way too much if we link  with her outfit change dancing w BS. What do you guys thinks?. Regards,. Follower of Mythus, The enigmata.    -. Sources:.

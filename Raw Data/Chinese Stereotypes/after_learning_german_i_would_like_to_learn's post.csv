thisorthatlanguage,antitodo666,t2_mcbgcolr,t3_1eb0ftw,,07/24/24 08:39,0,3,1.0,8,"""After learning German. So, I can speak English and Spanish (this one is my native language) and Im currently studying German. Then, when I get a good level of it, I would like to learn Russian or Chinese, but I dont know which one to choose. Heres a summary:. Russian :. +I love how it sounds. +A lot of ukrainians and russians living here. +Russia has an important history in science. +I like Russian literature, such as Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Pushkin  . +Very few of almost no regional/accent/dialect differences . -Very difficult grammar. -Sadly, has less influence here in Spain because of the war  . Chinese :. +Is very exotic, quite mysterious because of its sinitic roots instead of Indo-European . +Beautiful writing, quite artistic . +Most spoken language . +Various Chinese people living in my city. +Grammar is ridiculously easy. -I dont really like the sound of the language . -Youre always learning how to write the words. -It has no alphabet . -Infinity of dialectical differences "

Reasons for learning Chinese instead of Russian: much larger number of speakers (more than 4 times as many), the importance of China in the world (related but not identical to the first point), and the potential to balance out your study of European languages and expand your understanding of what language can be."""

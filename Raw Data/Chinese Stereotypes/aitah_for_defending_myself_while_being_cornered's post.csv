AITAH,One-Artichoke-2838,t2_g80yw0gh,t3_1dw49mb,,07/05/24 14:03,0,3,0.71,20,"""AITAH for defending myself while being cornered on a girls trip?. long story.  tried to make it short, i (21f) went on a girls trip w my best friend of 8 years (also 21f) we also went with her boyfriend’s sister (23f)  and that girl’s friend (24f). . the first two days of the trip i realized the other two girls dont really care for me. i was basically fourth-wheeling but since i spent 400 on this trip i wanted to make the best out of it. my bestfriend had invited me and introduced me to them beforehand, so i’m not sure what changed. my bsf was trying her best to keep me included but the other two girls were clearly ignoring any input i had, only speaking to me when they wanted to, skipping my songs on the playlist, giving looks of displeasure, etc. at some point i accepted it and figured that we had different personalities, especially when they all started making jokes about how chinese people eat dogs. (my bestfriend is intelligent and knows that this is wrong, untrue & racist, but was laughing along the entire time.). my bsf comes and speaks to me that night and says “i’ve noticed how they’ve been treating you don’t worry.” and we ranted about it for a little, and she hugs me because she says i don’t deserve any of it. at this point i feel better because i am validated and realize i’m not crazy and seeing things. . on the third day i notice my best friend starting to change right in front of my eyes. snarky comments, looks, glares, as if we haven’t been close since 7th grade. as if she didn’t know me at all and was morphing into the energy the two other girls were giving me. the last night we all get some drinks and at this point, i was very fed up and needed to defend myself because i was being cornered and feeling bullied and left out. i admit i should not have drank the amount that i did and this might have caused the altercation. heavily intoxicated, i said some things i shouldn’t have said (this was all repeated back to me by the girls) - i insulted them based on their bodies and looks and told them to “unalive” themselves. although i don’t remember any of this as i was heavily intoxicated. the two girls ganged up on me as i’m sobering up, yelling and screaming, taking my travel swiss army knife because they were scared i was going to “harm” them, and also saying that they’d leave me in a city 4 hours away from home. i understand feeling scared if someone you dont know says these things to you, but i genuinely had built up a disliking for these girls over the past 3 days. why like someone who can’t stand you? . at that point i feel so alone and cornered that i figured it’d be best to just find a train home. my best friend was also heavily considering leaving me 4 hours away as she calls another friend of mine and asks if there is anyone to pick me up. i’m also close friends with my bestfriends sister who was on her honeymoon at the time (i completely forgot in my state of panic) and called her asking what i should do. my bestfriend said “are you trying to get me in trouble with my sister?!” and i responded “no i’m just tryna get home safe.”. one of the other girls goes online with my last name and tries to find my family’s contact info to “show them videos of me being drunk” and threatens to send videos of us partying the day before. (my family is heavily religious and this would lead to me being in a very difficult spot with them. basically homeless. they do not know i drink). at this point i’m sobbing because i feel so scared and vulnerable and they all start yelling at me to stop crying and “playing” victim. . my best friend was on board with all of this behavior. she was tagging along with them entirely. everything subsides when they finally agree to take me home w them as long as i “put airpods in and shut the fuck up.” i can’t remember who said this to me from the three of them. . my bestfriend hasn’t spoken to me in 5 days (after promising to debrief with me and discuss things) except for “you owe me 50 dollars” for a dress that i never wore - she intended to return the dress on amazon after the trip but now she wants to charge me for it. . what i’m taking away from this is that i genuinely tried my best while being treated poorly for the first 3 days and then i snapped on the 4th day once alcohol was in me. i needed to defend myself, because i truly felt so alone. i don’t know anymore i’m just grieving losing my best friend. she’s ignoring me and won’t answer me.

You might need to work on rage issues (especially if you come from a deeply religious family). Also your best friend is likely not the person you think she is. If she is willing to go along with you being put down and insulted and the other friends being openly racist (well atleast for the first 3 days afterwords I can understand her also being angry)."""

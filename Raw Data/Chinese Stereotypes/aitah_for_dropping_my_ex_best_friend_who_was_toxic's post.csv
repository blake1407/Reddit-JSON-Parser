AITAH,stelllvester,t2_o5lridy6k,t3_1e0tira,,07/11/24 12:45,0,1,0.99,1,"""aitah for dropping my ex best friend who was toxic?. some TW’s: mentions of self harm, family issues/problems. (Please keep in mind we are both 14 years old) Her name is H for this story. This all started when H and me were going to the train station after school. That day i was very hungry so i brought a packet of malteasers and she asked if she could have some, I obviously said no because i was extremely hungry that day and she said “ I know for a fact you get fed at home “. I just paused and stood there for a good minute while she walked into the station. I followed her and ignored her the whole way home. The next day i ignored her completely i didn’t look in her direction at all. It was our last day of exams and we finished early at 1:10 and while waiting to leave i heard her say to my other friend “Look at her hair, she has no friends” while you could clearly see i was talking to my other friends S and D. So i messaged her on social media saying to her why were you talking about me and she started saying “I never did that… Who told you that?….” Bare in mind she’s known to be a gaslighter and a manipulator and then she blocked me on every social media she has me on and then a while later my friend E texts me saying that H doesn’t know what she has done wrong so i had to write a whole paragraph that takes up a total of 3 screenshots. (I will copy and paste it at the end) This all happened on thursday the 4th july, so exactly a week ago as i’m writing this. My school had friday and monday off so nothing happened then but on tuesday all 5 of us usually meet up to go to school so we met up as usual but as soon as i sat down she got up and left and Z ran after her while E and K sat with me. At break time i was talking to my friends and they told me they saw H crying, I obviously didn’t care because i was still angry. Later at lunch, my friend A said she went home early yet again i didn’t care. During at like 6pm my friend A texted me and sent me screenshots of what she said responding to this and i could see she was using things like ellipses and periods to make it more dramatic and guilt trip my friend A. A was rude to me for a day but apologised the next day because she realised she was being rude to me but she thinks i’m the asshole. Am i really the asshole for dropping someone who made many hurtful jokes to me and then she got angry when i accidentally made one about her (context behind this is that she self harms sometimes and shes not allowed a pencil sharpener and her crush asked her if she had one and i said “ shes not allowed one “ he just walked off and said okay, i realised what i said was too loud and i apologised immediately after and she start complaining to me saying i’m rude and don’t have manners) One more thing to add is that she’s white and says “i’m european white!!!” thinking shes better than any other white person because she’s polish and her crush is from the caribbean, he said something racist about chinese people and she said “it’s okay because its him” and i just gave her the dirtiest look ever and carried on walking infront of her because that was so disgusting of her to say that but yet again i’m not surprised she would say something like that and she seems to have a weird obsession with my asian friends because shes had crushes on all of them since she joined the friend group which it has been like 3 weeks now. What she has done to me:. first of all, she always begs for food when i buy her something she refuses to buy me something when i actually need it, she leaves me alone when she sees MY friends, she tells others about MY family problems which i only tell to people that i trust so i don’t tell anyone anything anymore and when i said to shaheen shes not allowed a sharpener she got angry but when she tells L that my dad might leave i just have to sit there and laugh it off its not funny it actually hurts me and when she keeps venting to me without asking but i am also going through something i dont care okay i want to focus on bettering myself first she keeps saying that im not portuguese and im faking it, she keeps saying i replaced her and i have a girlfriend but theyre all just my friends, today i heard her speaking to Z saying “she has no friends look at her hair” and started laughing even though i was talking to S and D and she keeps commenting how i eat so much and im selfish and said “i know you get fed at home” ??? how do you know? i actually dont because my parents refuse to talk to eachother they dont do the weekly food shopping so theres barley anything in my fridge it got so bad that last week i have takeaway every single day and i know its not healthy but i cant do anything about it and she just does cringe stuff in general its weird it icks me like when she begs for food she put her hands and head on the table and starts fake sulking for food and she kept mentioning “what would you do if your friends left you” but i know they wouldnt because they actually like me and who are you to be saying that like i literally helped u join us because i felt bad now your literally talking to me like this she needs to know her place and also how she said shes gonna move up into x band and leave me alone and also instead of actually talking to me she blocks me on everything and thats not my problem so no im not going to talk to her because i dont like toxic people. (KEEP IN MIND SHE HAS NEVER APOLOGISED FOR ANY OF THIS). Am i the Asshole?, My friend A think’s i am.  "

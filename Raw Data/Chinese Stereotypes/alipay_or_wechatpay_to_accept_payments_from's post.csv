I am an Ecuadorian artisan and I have found it difficult to accept payments, it seems that international cards are not common, and PayPal has very few users in that country. Everyone suggests that I accept payment methods such as Alipay or Wechatpay. The foreign merchant versions of Alipay and Wechatpay are unavailable in my country. I could use payment gateways that accept these methods, but they ask me for a history of sales in China. I have my Alipay and Wechat accounts verified, I have the QR code to accept payments in both, I know that the limits for foreigners have increased to 5000 USD per payment and 50000 USD per year. I see several non-Chinese people buying and selling balances on exchanges, so accepting payments below that limit seems like a good option to explore. Generally, e-wallets give problems when you want to get money from their system or leave your account at zero. In theory, money would never leave the system if you exchange it. Do you have any experience with buying balance? What have been the inconveniences?. What are the most common problems that cause them to block accounts?"

Technically, the company that offers you card processing may also be able to easily provide you with AliPay, WeChat Pay, and UnionPay. Hope this helps."""

I can change the balance from another wallet or cryptocurrency; any option is good for making a test. To withdraw the funds only way I found is the P2P cryptocurrency. It is much cheaper to exchange that balance for a stablecoin; I will lose some money in commissions, the same or less than what a bank charges you for a card transaction. Thank you for your suggestion."""

Ali has many restrictions for foreigners. So although it is widely accepted in airport duty free around the world, as foreigners cannot use overseas (even in HK). Chinese nationals can, so find a friend and make the experiment?"""

The Republic of China is the largest and Asian Country, it is the most populated Country in the World. FLAG. The Flag of the Republic of China is a Tricolor with a Yin Yang in the center of it. Each stripe represents the three “Chinese Peoples”. The top red stripe represents Han Chinese people, the mid yellow stripe represents the Manchu people, and the bottom blue stripe represents Mongolians. POPULATION. China is the most populated country in the world, having a total of 2 Billion and a half people. 64% of the population is Han Chinese, 22% Manchurian, 11% Mongolian and 3% Tibetan. ORIGINS. The Nation formed when two para military groups formed the United Front. A collection of the Right Wing Chinese Nationalist Party lead by Chiang Kai Sak, and the Left Wing Chinese Communist Party lead by Mao Zedong, The Japanese invaded China, taking regions of Inner Manchuria. In 1945 Operation Downfall commenced, the Soviets with the aid of Chinese Communists invaded from the North, whilst the Americans with the help of the Chinese Nationalists invaded from the South. In the “Treaty of Eternal Friendship and Cooperation” in 1946 the Soviets gave Outer Manchuria, and Tuva, two regions the Soviets and Imperial Russians had taken from China, to the Chinese Communist Party, which later was annexed into China proper. A NATION DIVIDED. China has two cultural zones. The North and the South. The North, dominated by the Chinese Communist Party, is centered around collectivism. North Chinese culture focuses heavily labour and the betterment of the people and nation. They focus on labour and strength, believing that weakness is a great sin, that can only be healed from sheer hard work and determination. The South, dominated by the Chinese Nationalist Party, is more rural but still heavily populated, it focuses on Individualism. South Chinese Culture believes people should focus on their own self first rather than the group. In South Chinese Culture, the family is seen as the most important brick in the nation, believing heavily in gender roles and natalism. The two cultural zones hate and despise each other, China is in fact the most politically unstable Nation that isn’t in a Civil War in the world. The Nation hasn’t gone under a Civil War mainly because the Chinese people believe in “Chinese Unity”, an ideology say “Brother should not fight against Brother”. POLITICAL LANDSCAPE. China has 3 Region, 75 Provinces, 1 Autonomous Region, and 1 Autonomous City. Each Region has its own Parliament known as Lower Yuans, but the highest Parliament is known as the Grand National Congress, it is the largest parliament in the world, having a total of 5000 seats. China has a two party system, because of this, policies and ideologies have become more and more polarized as time goes on. Tibet doesn’t get any recognition in parliament, but in turn, the parliament cant in force laws in Tibet, only controlling foreign policy and armed forces. . China isa pivotal nation in the ongoing Cold War, constantly switching sides depending on who’s in power.  "

As the division started much before, in 1927.  At first Soviet Union trained and gave money to Nationalists, but soon after, the whole help along with the intel was given to communists who started undermining and questioning each nationalists decisions which soon led to Shanghais massacre and civil war.xa0"""

If they hated each other, but they didnt want to fight, it would be more logical that they would divide the country in two parts and rule their own part independally in their own way."""

Operation Downfall (Allied Plan to invade Japan) stated that the USSR aould invade Inner Manchuria and Korea, completely taking it. 2. in this timeline (This post is part of a much bigger alternative history Ive been working on a long time) Korea is considered a part of China. Culturally, ethically, just its always been like that. In short Korea nevah existed or at least was brutally suppressed."""

Allies would also pressed it for possible mainland allied territory near Japan where there were US troops. And south could see the chance to undermine the north."""

Always bothered me that they just modeled it as some fuedal kingdom when it was more of a military governorship that the emperor bestowed to the family. The new admin government type seems like the closest thing well get to this, so I hope they implement it to give people a reason to actually try it that isnt just the novelty of being the only Chinese people on the map. Havent kept up with the dev diaries, so Im unsure if this was already answered."

No shot youre gonna tell me the Carolingans were an admin government, but the only playable Han realm isnt lmao. Then again, these are just the optional ones. Hopefully, they just made Guiyi admin by default like the Byzantines since they literally would be."""

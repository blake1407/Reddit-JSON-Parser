crueltyfree,ginaah,t2_4abse4h1,t3_1drvw1r,,06/30/24 03:16,0,8,0.91,1,"""are korean brands automatically cruelty free if they don’t sell physically in china?. might’ve seen me post abt this before lol sry but i was researching a brand and they have a vegan verification that said this abt animal testing:. “For products with the V-label, the manufacturer (licence holder) must not carry out or have carried out experiments on animals of any kind. This applies both to the domestic market and to the foreign market (e.g. under the requirements of government authorities). The company must also not carry out or commission any animal testing for the ingredients and production aids in relation to the end product.” . i was doubtful of how secure this was bc v-label seems to say that love beauty and planet is cruelty free and they’re in a sort of grey area rn bc of how they sell in china. the korean brand im searching for however, is a lot smaller and from the different chinese people ive asked this brand isn’t available for sale in physical stores in china anyway, only some in korea and japan. given this, is it safe to say that this korean brand is cruelty free since animal testing is already banned for cosmetics and ingredients in korea?"

asianamerican,deleted,,,t1laxbk9b,,1,5,0,1,""" rarely run by Japanese people (in the US). Something interesting I learned when I talked with a Japanese restaurateur over drinks. Generally speaking starting and getting a foothold for a Japanese restaurant is difficult. Lots of nuances and real-time adaptation needed based on the clientele. Something only those who have lived in Japan can do. He said this because Chinese and Koreans who were raised in Japan can do the same. What this means is that many Japanese restaurateur go into a business of opening a Japanese restaurant then selling it to the other Asians or becoming consultants. Usually Chinese or Koreans. That being said, Japanese immigrants to the US isnt that much anymore so that also feeds into why there is less Japanese-run restaurants."""

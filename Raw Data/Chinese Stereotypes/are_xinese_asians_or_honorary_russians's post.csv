Youll find a shocking difference between China and other Asian countries, mostly in terms of ideology and attitude against western world. They despise Koreans, Japanese, Philippines, even the same communist Vietnamese. But they have a fanatic cultural affinity to Soviet and even post-Soviet Russia. Before 1983, even after the battle of Damansky island that froze the Sino-Soviet relationship, Russian was the most common foreign language taught in Chinese schools. They copied everything from Soviets, totalitarian politics, abusive education, eating habits, medical procedures, even the tiniest bits in everyday life. The clothing and quilts decorated with bright, colorful flowers that almost triggers trypophobia are often considered as the stereotype of Manchuria by the Chinese, but actually their flagrant design was a Soviet importation originally started production in Shanghai, 1950s. You can still see shocking resemblance between Chinese products in Maos era and Soviet ones, except some minor remnants of Chinese cultural elements. After the collapse of USSR, China became the only country that nearly everyone admired and worshipped Soviet Union as the threat under Soviet nukes after 1969 Damansky Incident gradually diminished. They began to produce cheap Soviet merchs, and almost had an addiction on Soviet elements, like Vodka, Kalashnikov automats, and ignored the fact that the rape and killing of Red Army committed in Manchuria. As the surge of ultra nationalism, foreign things are often accused as anti-China and boycotted. However Russians seemed to have total immunity against this issue, even Russians seems like to mock and bully the Chinese for their entertainment, and never regard them as their ""Soviet buddies"". Several days ago, in a Chinese university, the Russian students called the Chinese students chng chng. Yet such activities are not considered as a racial slur but a sign of friendliness by the university officials. Belarus, as almost completely russified, shares the same privileges. Once the Belarusian students played the music ""Ching Cheng hanji"" with Tom rotating on the phonograph when they see a Chinese student passing by. The Chinese student, not awared of the existence of this meme, said""Theyre playing Peking Opera"" and took that footage. The Chinese media reported it as ""showing the admire of Chinese culture"". Since the outbreak of Russo-Ukrainian war, both Chinese officials and civilians showed their fanatic support of Russia, and Russia is mocked by dissidents as ""Father Russia"". During the economy sanction after the Crimea crisis, the CCP decided to buy Russian gas at shocking high prices, and forced the Chinese villages to transition to gas heating instead of traditional coal heating, in the expense of the sheer amount of heating expense of people and some rural peoples life due to their inability to afford gas and hypothermia in freezing winter. As my personal experience, my family lived in a small flat on the corner of a poorly insulated building at that time. They installed a gas heater as the central heating was almost futile against the sweeping chillness. The gas had contributed to 1/4 of our familys monthly expenses. Since 2022 the things went even more blatant. There are even a few Chinese people that volunteered to invade Ukraine, despite their life expectancy be measured in days, if not hours. Zhao Rui, the first confirmed Chinese casualty on the Russian side, survived no more than a month after hes sent to the front lines."

The Soviets were forced to transfer 700k-1 million men and thousands of other military resources to the Chinese border after the Sino Soviet split which otherwise wouldve been used in Europe to give the Soviets an overwhelming advantage. . I mean even after the transfer, the Warsaw pact was still the superior force in Europe but without it they wouldve been in a much better position. In fact maybe they wouldve cut down on numbers altogether and avoided spending 10-20% of their GDP on military therefore avoiding economic collapse. . The top 5% of Chinese are the Jews of Asia while the rest of 95% are cattles"""

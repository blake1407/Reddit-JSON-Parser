She probably won  since even Hillary Clinton, a white woman, couldn  beat Trump. And also the fact that the sexism and racism against her is rearing its head quickly (it even pisses me off that people keep referring to her as ""Kamala"", but  Donald and Joe and Barack by their last names. It just seems sexist to me, like shes not being taken seriously. Even people in this sub keep doing it)). But anyways, I just really hope that she wins. Ive been really struggling with myself lately, especially as an engineer, where literally no one looks like me , and Im at the mercy of extremely shitty behavior from white people (especially white women who want to bring themselves up, but put me down, and white men who don  even see me as a human being). If Im lucky, Ill have a few Chinese people around who are the only ones who treat me with respect since they also seem to be mistreated by whites from my observation (not to sound racist but other types of east Asians I see try too hard to kiss white peoples asses). Ive had to deal with people cussing at me, screaming at me, telling me Im dumb to my face, throwing me under the bus so Id get in trouble, picking their stuff up when I pass by or while making eye contact with me, as if Im looking to steal, rudely demanding to know why Im in a lab working (despite the fact that you literally need swipe card access to get into any of the lab spaces in the building), ignoring my input and making me feel left out of the group, not inviting me to outings. Ive even had people in group projects try to give me the ""easy work"" so I don  mess anything up (even though Im a straight A student) and get upset if I try to talk more than 1.5 minutes during a presentation while they talk for over 5 lmao. . Even other black people are a threat. I was happy that there were two other black people in my lab, but the guy (Ghanaian) is extremely sexist and will not work with me or the other woman in the lab (whos Nigerian). Im in grad school, and I just got my TA assignment last week and Im already freaking out because the last time I TAd a class, the students would ask all the other TAs for help except for me and were extremely rude towards me or would ignore me when I did try to help. So Ive been trying to look for ways to get out of it because it gives me intense anxiety. But I feel like if Harris wins and becomes the FIRST FEMALE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, even before a white woman.  then damn I got no excuses then lol. I gotta give it my all from that day forward. "

I think a lot of it has to do with the fact - and its really a simple one - that Indians have darker skin. Even though Indians are into colorism themselves, they dont get that their skin color - which black people think is so pretty - white people dont like, its dark and whites dont like that. Even a white woman annoyed that to me YEARS ago. Its like it confuses them."""

No matter how qualified they are. . The racial shit against black women will skyrocket. As a girl on tiktok said, its important now more than ever for us to protect our peace if she wins. But I also think if she wins, this could be inspiring. Education rates amongst black women will skyrocket more than they already have, and we might get a lot more firsts for black women. . Thats if centrists and leftists can put aside some of the racial biases a lot of them still have and vote for Kamala. Im going to do my part, and I truly hope she wins so we can dig out of this mess."""

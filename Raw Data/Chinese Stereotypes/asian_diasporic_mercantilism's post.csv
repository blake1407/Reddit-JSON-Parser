If youre subscribed toxa0r/Asian, you probably already realize that America and its Anglo allies have declared economic war on Asian economies, most notably and currently China (following victory over Japan in the 1980s). I have spoken with people who engage in economic and geopolitical forecasting, and Im here to tell you that things are going to get worse. For one thing, I am told that the TikTok ban is expected to be passed by the end of the year, and it wont be limited to TikTok. I am also told that corrupt American politicians and their lazy business lackeys are pushing for a removal of Chinas most-favored-nation status with the WTO. This should be obvious, but we need to side with our Asian brothers and sisters against the neo-colonial, Anglo rapists (economic and literal). Again, I cannot emphasize this enough: these racists hatred isnt limited to China or Chinese people. It knows no national boundaries and is part-and-parcel with the wave of hate crimes targeting Asian Americans in recent years. I anticipate an acceleration of anti-Asian American ethnic cleansing efforts by the American government and private institutions. Companies already refuse to hire Asian Americans at par with other Americans of comparable ability. Heres how I am responding and how I encourage others to respond: support Asian-owned businesses in any way possible. Stop giving your money to neo-colonial rapists who are trying to exterminate us.xa0STOP. GIVING. YOUR. MONEY. TO. PEOPLE. TRYING. TO. EXTERMINATE. US.xa0This means to stop attending American sporting events or watching the NFL/NBA/NHL, stop watching non-Asian shows on television/streaming services. Better yet, cancel your Amazon/Netflix/Apple subscriptions. Dont buy a fucking Tesla or other American EV. (Replace it with Hyundai or a Chinese/Vietnamese EV if you can get one.). Heres how this looks in my life:xa0My phone is Samsung. My computer is Asus, with AMD and NVIDIA chips. I use DoorDash, Chowbus, or Weee! for food and grocery delivery. For beverages, I choose amongxa0Sans,xa0Sool,xa0Sanzo,xa0Hummy,xa0Dokkaebier,xa0Lunar, and others. For furniture, I buyxa0Zinus,xa0Outer, orxa0Silk and Snow. I buyxa0Italicxa0clothing. I buy kitchen equipment fromxa0Material. I rely onxa0Bluelandxa0for all household cleaning products. I usexa0Monosxa0luggage. For everything else, I have replaced ALL of my Amazon purchases with Temu purchases. Thats just my physical possessions. On my phone, I have the following apps: Notion, Coupang, Zoom, TikTok, SHEIN, Kin, Coffee Meets Bagel, Temu, Opendoor, coursera, NerdWallet, moomoo, Webull, and Vinovest Portfolio. I dont even like/have much use for some of these (never managed to sync up with TikToks algorithm, for example). But I still support them because theyre an Asian-founded company. Tl;dr:xa0America and other Anglo nations are at war with the Asian diaspora, and we need to start acting like it in terms of how we spend our money and buy EXCLUSIVELY from Asian-owned brands."

Certainly not reality. I have no clue what you were saying about a consensus and being in danger. Theres no downside to supporting exclusively Asian-owned businesses.  On the very rare chance Im wrong about America being a racist, anti-Asian shithole, all Ive done is support our own people, which is never a bad thing. But America is a racist, anti-Asian shithole, as all the data and real-world events show."""

Asian Americans gravitate to higher Asian population centers because thats where we feel the safest. We dont have to deal with the racist and microagressive shit that comes with living in a mostly non-Asian area. Plus Ive been around Asian reddit to know that any Asian that lives in an area in which they are the only or one of the few Asians around tend to have higher rates of internalized racism and white worship. I sure as fuck wouldnt want my kids to grow up in such an environment."""
asian,supra3661,t294kixnqp,t1leu4ykq,t31ebj69k,07/25/24 03:20,1,3,0,4,"""Youre using the term rapists so loosely to convey a disgusting rhetoric towards, apparently, anyone who isnt Asian/Asian American (?) That is very dangerous. As an Asian American myself I am not gonna lie: it was hard but it showed me that there are more good Americans than the racist ones. Never was my growth stunted because of my race or ethnicity. Now am I speaking for all Asian Americans? Absolutely not. If the consensus can agree with your irate notion that were in danger than Im sorry and obviously have been out of the loop but correct me if Im wrong: we as Asian Americans tend to isolate ourselves or have a ostracizing approach where we tend to gravitate to mostly high denser Asian population. So .its kinda hard when we arent also actively trying to join other non Asian communities and expect them to treat us no different."""

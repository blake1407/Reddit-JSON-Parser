I been talking to some Chinese people on Qq recently . Like they have compassion but not empathy . It’s like they don’t really think on be half of your shoes , their mentality is that you either be better and shut up keep pushing or stop talking to me . It’s almost like the survival of the fittest concept. I hate this . And I am Chinese American myself , really hate how my people think sometimes "

It requires you to search deep in yourself, look at yourself and recognize, hey, you and I are not so different. It requires you have a honest perspective and that means coming terms that maybe youre not ok, youre not perfect, you dont have it all together and maybe you could be/can be better. . Empathy requires you to connect with the other person. Its hard to feel empathy if youre feeling superior to the other person. Empathy is humbling. With that said, I think empathy is essentially the antithesis to Asian culture. Saving face, accumulating approval, engineering social interactions so you always come out on top and reaping the most benefits, being morally/financially superior to others - none of these things work with empathy or kindness or compassion."""

This book can be translated into ""Humiliation Trauma: the most common but most bitter pain"". So, one important fact to learn is that ""humiliation is a way widely used by the authority to punish and control people who are less mighty in Asian culture."" Bad Asian parents and teachers humiliate and punish Asian kids not because of ""for your own good"" or ""to help you fit in society."" Based on this book, none of this is true, their humiliation is the way to control the kid to make their work easy.  After kids get used to this humiliation and ""believe"" that they deserve this BS, they grow up and become the next abuser. This is when things op described happen; they have no empathy and try to invalidate others feelings. This is how they were treated by others and how they treated themselves. Seeing similar experience trigger their brain and causes them to deny the fact that ""I was abused."".

There is historic precedence for such a ""non-empathic"" culture to emerge. The whole concept of individuality is a Western one, and a relatively recent one at that. Culture before has always been about fitting into a hierarchical structure for the majority of people. The only exceptions are those ""given divine right"". Now, people are realising that those with power and those without are fundamentally the same, so anyone can move within the hierarchy. What hasn  been realised is that the hierarchy doesn  exist in the first place. Without empathy, people are being driven to seek upward movement in the hierarchy. Even in the West, many people think this way, though not as prevalent. That is to say, widespread empathy is quite a novel and culturally advanced concept. Non-Western cultures fundamentally haven  had the time to develop the empathy that were discussing and its continuing to develop in the West still. I want to be clear that Im not saying individuals in any culture cannot be empathic. Its more evident when the ""problem"" is properly stated: Why are there proportionally more Asian people not empathic than Western people?

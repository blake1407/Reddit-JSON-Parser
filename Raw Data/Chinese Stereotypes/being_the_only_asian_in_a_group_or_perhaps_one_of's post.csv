TLDR: As an adopted Chinese person in the US, I sometimes feel isolated when Im the only Asian in a group and struggle to connect with those who share my experiences of marginalization. I long for community but hesitate to join Asian spaces due to fears of encountering nationalists or differing political beliefs. Reflecting on my life, I wonder about my upbringing in China and the stereotypes that overshadow the diverse lives of Chinese people. The economic factors of adoption also weigh on me, leaving me with a sense of loss and questioning identity. So sometimes Im the only Asian in a group, or maybe theyre others but we dont seem to connect or something and so I just feel so alone. Yes I know that there are other people and stuff but sometimes you just want to be around people who share the same oppression and marginalization so you so you can connect. . But Im scared to go into Asian spaces because I just dont want a bunch of nationalists around me. Thats always the worry when youre trying to create a space for people of a certain race. . Im not saying that its impossible to create a space like that without being racist, but it must require vigilance and enforcement. I dont have those resources and even if I did I wonder . Would I rather be in a group of people who make me feel connected and part of a culture but who hold political beliefs I disagree with. Or would I rather be in a group of people who I politically agree with but I dont feel connected to as part of a culture. By the way when I say culture in this case I am referring to the subculture of a particular marginalized group within the same country or community. For example an Asian person in Japan isnt going to have the same life stories as a Japanese-American who does have those experiences. . Also when I say politically disagree with it could range from highly right-wing problematic all the way to something like being more progressive on the outside while still supporting oppressive systems. I was born in China and adopted by white parents and brought to the US and sometimes I think what life would be like if I had stayed in china. Would I be bilingual? What would go on? I think people get scared about China and think its all factory workers but Chinese people do live normal lives too. Not everyone is a factory worker sweatshop people. . If I had been adopted by another Asian person then that person would have been financially well off in order to be able to do the adoption. This is because the adoption agencies are for profit. This means that if I had been adopted into China by Chinese person then I would not have probably worked in a sweatshop because I wouldnt need to. I wouldnt have been that poor. . I cant help but feel stolen."
TMPOC,endroll64,t22jwwxss7,t1l91qtev,t1l91p4qu,06/17/24 16:03,3,3,0,0,""">When I asked my mom why she picked someone from China she said she always wanted a little Asian doll. . Im so sorry; this is so incredibly hurtful and objectifying to hear, especially from a parent. . Whilst its not the same, I still deeply empathize as someone who is mixed race and likewise struggles to find community. A lot of my white friends are just extremely oblivious to a lot of intersections of marginalization that they dont experience, but I have been pretty much unable to find other queer Asians for the reasons youve described (a general tendency for many Asian diaspora to be more right-leaning). To make matters worse, my parents specifically tried to raise me in a more Western/white-centric culture (despite the fact that my mom and I never really fit into this picture), so it feels hard to connect to other POC sometimes since my parents tried to separate me from them. .  I dont really have any good advice, but I do empathize."""
TMPOC,Arktikos02,t2r7uww8zo,t1l91p4qu,t1l90onx6,06/17/24 15:37,2,3,0,1,"""Yeah, but Ive gone through different friends before and they keep betraying me. . The most recent group I am in treated being really nicely up until I started criticizing their own group for being ableist and stuff and then they were wondering why I was acting that way. . Apparently Im only good to people when I am a nice pretty thing among their collection but once I start having real opinions and criticizing the way things are going then people dont like me anymore. . Just like with my own family. When I asked my mom why she picked someone from China she said she always wanted a little Asian doll. . Theres only about 3% to 4% of people in my city who are considered Asian American. . Its about a hundred people more than those that are considered native American. . And yet people still champion international adoption as if its saving these people when its stealing them. . Stories like Annie the orphan give people the impression that every adoption is like some Daddy Warbucks thing where just some rich person adopts you and that you live your happily ever after and they dont tell you about all the horror stories of adoption like rehoming which is where kids get placed on Craigslist to be unofficially adopted I mean human traffic to someone else all because the people change their minds. About 70% of rehommed kids part of international adoptions. But when people hear the idea of stopped adopting from other countries people get offended. People have similar views of IVF where they feel like they are owed a child. They feel so entitled to that child as if just because they are infertile they deserve to have IVF more. . If it were up to me I would say that IVF should be up to a lottery system. It would be a randomization system but only people who are chosen get to have one. A good percentage of people would be able to have one but not everyone and this would mean that people are more grateful for their children rather than feeling like they are owed one as if they bought it off of a store. . Is it fair? No but life isnt fair sometimes. . Also how do we know these people arent just creating savior siblings which is where you have a second child to basically just beat the second pair of organs for your first child who you super love. . There was a movie about this situation by the way. Believe it was called My sisters keeper."""
TMPOC,meadowlair,t2zciztwitq,t1l90onx6,t31dhrw6e,06/17/24 12:13,1,5,0,1,"""I hope youre doing okay friend. I cant truthfully know what youre going through, I am so sorry you feel so isolated. I hope and know youll find good friends soon, and those whom you can relate with well. I think there are many people in similar shoes. I also think that many young people like you would feel the same, and would hold similar beliefs. do not worry, you will not have to choose between feeling not/connected and political beliefs. I hope you find them sooner than later, that you can reconnect with your roots"""
TMPOC,Arktikos02,t2r7uww8zo,t1l9bmfdz,t1l99zspn,,0,1,0,0,"""Oh I bring IVF but Im more referring to like IVF parents more than the children. Since Im not one I cannot speak in that regard but as for like the adults, Im just referring to the same mindset of a lot of adoptive parents. In fact its probably not unusual for an adoptive parent to first go for IVF. I know my mom did for example. She first tried the old-fashioned way and then tried IVF and then she went for adoption. . Im talking about the kind of entitled parent that thinks that just because they are able to throw a lot of money at an agency and then receive a child then that means like they deserve it or something. Mine mine mine. Why cant I get a family like everyone else? Yeti yada yada. . Whatever happened to the phrase that every child deserves a parent but not every parent deserves a child? Its a phrase you hear a lot when people hear of abuse but really its just a cereal box phrase. It doesnt mean anything because people are not willing to tell others that they dont actually deserve a kid. Theyre too afraid to because in reality they dont want to seem anti-parent. In many cases many people do think they deserve a kid. . The kinds of people who partake in these two industries that profit off of the creation of families, yes profit, can often be quite entitled people. Now Im not saying none of them will be good parents but the thing is is that the kinds of people who can do this are wealthier. . Wealthier people have been shown to behave differently and often more entitled due to the fact that they have wealth. It has also been shown that people within the upper income brackets and those who make around six figures can also have fewer CPS visits called on them whereas people who are poor tend to have more CPS visits. . CPS visits do not actually determine whether or not a group of people is actually more abusive. Rich people are able to evade CPS a lot easier. People think that just because a child is wanted that that means that they will be not abused or something when thats not necessarily true."""
TMPOC,mystoken,t26jl8nm18,t1l99zspn,t1l992m1e,06/19/24 11:41,3,4,0,1,"""I agree that the general population likes to think that adoption is good and considering the structure behind adoption is so awful (especially international adoption) historically it harms more people than it does good. . I dont know where you got on a tangent to write about IVF and Im a little confused. I dont think Im supposed to be the subject of your argument. . Regardless, it seems that youre very wrapped into the discussion around adoption and IVF. But just because there are people who are oblivious to all these issues doesnt mean that you have to be silenced. It also doesnt mean you have to fight for your rights all the time. A couple years ago, I dug more into my own history and I had watched all the documentaries and read books and articles about adoption. I was obsessed, it ruled my life and I couldnt think of anything else. After a few years I can say I have mellowed down. Not so much that I dont want to fight for our rights and future adoptee rights, but more so that I have found some peace in existing. . What I mean is, that becoming obsessed with this subject is a sure fire way to make you feel depressed and helpless. I suggest you take a break from this, maybe even just a day or a week. Clear your mind a little. This is just what Im observing from you right now and I could be totally wrong."""
TMPOC,Arktikos02,t2r7uww8zo,t1l992m1e,t1l96jyu2,06/18/24 22:24,2,2,0,1,"""Yeah, but if people start saying that kind of stuff then people like us are accused of being anti-adaption or just wanting to hate on infertile couples. Agencies are not legally required to do background checks for IVF in the US and many people actually object to the idea of background checks for IVF which is strange. . So many people who do IVF for adoption are so entitled. . Adoption was the best thing that happened to me . IVF was the best thing for us. Adoption and IVF are not a solution to your parent woes. And I swear to God people are so entitled when they think that they can just throw money at an agency and get a baby. And yet Im accused of hating on infertile couples? Oh yeah and then just bring out LGBT people for some reason as if like being gay gives you the right to also do it? . Theres like this gay guy whos also like I think a senator or congressman or whatever and he has a husband and they did IVF and stuff. Religious people were obviously objecting to this because I guess gay people are gross, but Im actually kind of objecting too. . Now I bet these people probably have good intentions but they are going about it all wrong. Do not share that stuff on social media. People might try to argue that you can do it for biological children so why not ivf? The difference is that IVF as well as adoption are huge industries that are for profit and often benefit off of other peoples infertilities. . You are essentially creating propaganda for these industries. This is not the same thing when it comes to having children biologically. . Not only that but for some reason people are suggesting or at least have suggested adopting children from places like Gaza or Ukraine which is disgusting because both of those places are experiencing military conflicts (I mean genocides)."""
TMPOC,mystoken,t26jl8nm18,t1l96jyu2,t31dhrw6e,06/18/24 13:14,1,3,0,1,"""Hi buddy, Im sorry you are dealing with this too. Im also a Chinese adoptee adopted by white parents and trans/nonbinary. Not a great hand to be dealt. I can relate to pretty much all of what youre saying here. Even some things I have felt and never put words to, so thank you. . Its a lot to work through, even after years and years of good therapy I still struggle to find my place in the world. Not fitting in with the majority of white LGBT spaces and not fitting in Asian/Chinese spaces. Ive yet to find a place where I can both be understood as an Chinese adoptee AND a nonbinary person. Thats the dream. If you ever want to talk about this you can DM me anytime :)"""

I’m telling you that before you need someone to help you with that, you need to work on your own understanding of AAPI identity. I’m from a small town with a population under 10,000 and was one of TWO Asian families in the entire town. We did not have any leftist or even liberal groups AT ALL - we had people flying confederate flags and MAGA merch. But I still do not hold the beliefs that you have. . I am trying to tell you that before you put the burden of deconstructing your internalized racism on other Asians, you need to deconstruct it on your own like so many other Asian-Americans from rural or majority white or majority conservative areas have."""
TMPOC,Arktikos02,t2r7uww8zo,t1l9ryx6h,t1l9rqhq6,06/22/24 12:04,4,0,0,1,"""No, Im not saying I cant find a healthy identity without getting into conservatism or nationalism. . Im saying that its like I cant find anyone who could help me find that. Left this really arent about the whole like race identity kind of stuff. Its not that it is impossible to find, its that its hard. . As for the idea that there are plenty of mutual aid groups out there. Theres about a few handful of mutual aid groups within my own city. They all suck. I am currently in one that marks itself as anarchist and leftist and they are ableist and terrible. Some of the other groups are not so good either. . I have had bad experiences where I was in groups and then it turns out that there were people that the group would not kick out and so I had to leave those groups. . I have already told you that there are no Asian American leftist communities in my city. . Think of it like this. Lets say you are really hungry and you would like to do fishing. Do you create a net to cast a wide net and capture as many fish as possible or do you try to do individual fishing? Because heres the thing, if you catch the wrong fish then youre going to have to go through all of your catch and find them whereas if you do it individually then you just have to inspect each one individually rather than having to inspect all of them in your catch. . Also could you please not tell me how you would potentially exclude me if this was like a real life situation because Im already feeling excluded in many other situations and Im fucking suicidal. I already feel effing excluded and I dont need more of this. . You are not helping and I dont like what you keep saying. . You seem to think I have options and I dont because pretty much every leftist place in the city is actually terrible. . Its like youre not listening. .

TMPOC,frogandtoadaregay,t2570ski5a,t1l9rqhq6,t1l9plbdv,06/22/24 11:50,3,3,0,1,"""You are conflating your experiences on Reddit (which leans far-right anyway) with real life. All of the examples you gave are of online behavior and online discourse that is rarely present in IRL Asian spaces. Also, you said yourself that you don’t have much experience with your own culture, Asian-American identity, or even with other American POC identities in general. Why do you think you starting a group would lead to successful community outcomes? What experience do you have as a mutual aid organizer?? So many AAPI mutual aid, community outreach, and social justice organizations already exist. You need to let go, again, of your sweeping generalizations of the AAPI community and try harder to get out of the online discourse bubble, which OF COURSE is going to skew conservative. . Many of these groups post on Instagram or Facebook about events they organize; you can also look on Eventbrite for your city, or even keep an eye out for old-school flyers. If you’re more so looking for one-on-one interactions rather than a group setting, I still suggest you try to unlearn your internalized biases. They are very obvious from the way you speak about us; I am a staunch leftist, but if I met you in person I would not want to discuss anti-capitalist beliefs with you because I would be more taken aback by your internalized racism about the AAPI community. Community must go both ways. You cannot expect to be welcomed into these spaces when you’re literally comparing us to Nazis for …. Having more than a “healthy dose” of pride about our ethnicity?!. You said you can’t even imagine a healthy way of connecting to your race and identity without getting into conservatism and nationalism and that’s honestly just sad to me. Your beliefs about us as the AAPI community are so limiting, and deeply entrenched in factual misinformation. You are not ready to be welcomed into Asian community spaces before you gain more self-awareness of your own identity. If I were a group organizer, I wouldn’t want you there bc even in this post and reply you have dropped so many casual microaggressions abt Asians that are stereotypical of white Americans’ beliefs about us. I suggest you start with things you can do as an INDIVIDUAL so that you are not putting the burden of your internalized racial identity issues on other Asians in a group setting. . Books I recommend are Minor Feelings, Geisha of a Different Kind, Q&A: Queer in Asian America, Becoming Asian-American, My Life: Growing up Asian in America, and the Loneliest Americans. I recommend actual BOOKS, which have been reviewed and edited and fact-checked, rather than online sources like … a literal subreddit where anyone is allowed to say anything …. as a starting point for learning more. There have also been many films lately centering on AAPI casts / identity like Minari or Everything Everywhere All At Once although those are far less academic."""
TMPOC,Arktikos02,t2r7uww8zo,t1l9plbdv,t1l9mevc6,06/21/24 22:37,2,0,0,1,"""Hi, so I just want to clarify. I didnt mean to make like a generalization that all Asians have the same political beliefs cuz I know thats not true. . Here Ill give an example with Europeans. Several years ago I was really into Europe and I really liked European politics and talking about Europe and stuff and I wanted to start sort of a pro-European just kind of like thing and I asked some people in my own city subreddit about maybe starting something like that up. . For some reason one of the people my DMs was just basically a white nationalist. . Its not that I think that all Asians are racist, its that when youre creating a space that is focused around race or culture, sometimes you can attract nationalists. So for example instead of me making some kind of group focusing just on like Asian culture or like a healthy dose of pride for ethnicity or something, I would probably focus it more on something like mutual aid focusing on the Asian communities, or something like that. Because heres the thing, it doesnt matter if a group has like 90% okay people or great people, if there is a single person who is like racist or nationalistic or you know far right or whatever and that group doesnt kick them out, then that means I have to leave the group and thats another group I have to leave. Im tired of leaving groups. Ive had experiences where I was in groups where people were practicing or believing in oppressive ideologies or whatever and the others did not kick them out. If youre at a dinner table and theres one Nazi and you dont kick out the Nazi, you have a table full of Nazis. Basically where I would make it very upfront that this is, a safe space for Asians, and it is totally supposed to be progressive and stuff like that. For example r/aznidentity its pretty much just filled with a bunch of racist people. Well they do try to also focus on things like sort of Asian solidarity, its not uncommon for people within that group to say things like Asian women should not date white men and any white man who is dating an Asian woman is because of yellow fever and stuff like that. . Again, its not that I think that every Asian has these beliefs, but for me I dont see how I could find a way to have a healthy feeling about my own race or identity and how to connect with that without getting into nationalism and basically being around conservatives. . When I am around leftists Im the only Asian. City I live in has a very small Asian American community. There is one group thats called yellow peril tactile which is sort of a gun safety mutual aid thing and thats pretty cool and they are explicitly anti-capitalist but unfortunately theyre not in my city. Also they deal with guns and Im not really a gun person. But for me I would much rather try to avoid groups like that and instead just focus on like individual one-on-one interactions instead. . Again I am very aware that there are leftist Asians, but in my city it doesnt seem like theres a lot of leftist Asian groups. People yes, but probably not groups. . I just wish I could meet those people or something but I dont know how to reach out to them or something."""
TMPOC,frogandtoadaregay,t2570ski5a,t1l9mevc6,t31dhrw6e,06/21/24 10:46,1,3,0,1,"""I’m first gen Korean American and it is true that some ethnic group spaces can be unwelcoming - for example, I’m not going to join the Korean Catholic Church community in my area because I know we will have differing beliefs. But I think your specific concern about “nationalism” absolutely makes no sense and sounds like internalized racism. White Americans are on average FAR more nationalist and likely to hold oppressive beliefs than Asian-Americans, who are generally children of immigrants and don’t have a strong connection to their parents’ home country or government. Also, statistically speaking most Asians that immigrate to America do so because they’re dissatisfied with the conditions in their home country, whether social, economic, political, etc…. I understand it can be difficult to overcome the feeling of cultural isolation when you have white adoptive parents, but I urge you to better examine your own views and reflect on why you feel this way about an entire race of people you admittedly don’t interact with that much. There are also SO many queer AAPI spaces, Asian artist collectives, or activist groups that I’ve been a part of that are very leftist and support QTPOC of all backgrounds. Why do you think all Asians have the same political beliefs?? Why do you think all-POC spaces could even have the possibility to be “racist” and that they require “vigilance and enforcement”? . These are racist and white supremacist beliefs (you are literally saying all white people are more likely to have left-leaning political beliefs than all Asians, but years and years of political research and polling data absolutely disprove this). I have never felt more welcome as a queer or trans person in all-POC or all-AAPI spaces. You need to unlearn a lot of internalized racism. If you speak this way online, it’s likely that other Asian-Americans in real life avoid you or don’t feel community + solidarity with you because of YOUR beliefs about Asian-Americans, not their beliefs about queer people."""

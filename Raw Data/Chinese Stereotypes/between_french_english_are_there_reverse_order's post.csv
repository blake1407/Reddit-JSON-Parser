French,No_Pomegranate7134,t2_c2fdutgy,t3_1e9feuq,,07/22/24 10:16,0,0,0.38,10,"""Between French & English. To be clear, even though people say English & French are ""similar"" but they are not (despite both being Indo-European) given their backgrounds are different since English is classed as a Germanic language (on the same tier as Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Dutch & German) while French is a Romance language (same page as Portuguese, Spanish, Italian & Romanian) Plus ""Sortie"" does not look the same as ""Exit"" so theyre still different languages. I know for example between Japanese & Mandarin, there are words that look the ""same"" but have completely different pronunciations altogether as they are unrelated languages: Japanese being Japonic while Mandarin is Sino-Tibetan. What makes them mutually readable is they both use , kana is not intelligble to Chinese people but  is, although there are false friends to look out for, e.g.  (JP: Letter / ZH: Toilet paper) its the same for English & French: Pain (Bread) & Pain (Douleur). However when it comes to certain words translated from both Japanese & Mandarin, the word order is reversed upon translation (despite both using the same characters their pronunciation is very different), as reflected in the examples shown on the image below:. The character placement is switched between  & . (Shown in Red & Blue)"
French,ChibiSailorMercury,t24h0n4hka,t1lee2pzm,t1ledxmtu,07/22/24 11:05,0,7,0,0,"""I would add to what you said that when it comes to combination of nouns and/or verbs, the order in French and English often reversed: .  potato field = champ de pommes de terres.  maths class = cours de maths.  star gazing = observation détoiles.  wine glass = verre à vin.  pepper grinder = moulin à poivre.  strawberry ice cream = crème glacée à la fraise. (can you tell that Im hungry?). Also, in English, adjectives are always before the noun but, in French, most of adjectives are said ""postposés"" meaning written after the noun (yes, there are adjectives that go before the noun (""antéposés"") and some that can be in either position, but the majority are postposés).  green mug = tasse verte.  first born daughter = fille aînée.  solid table = table solide (you could say here that ""solide table"" can also be said, but this writing is a lot less used in non literary/formal contexts). same for words that are used as adjectives but are not adjectives like.  growing boy = garçon en pleine croissance"""
French,Neveed,t29jh3d4lm,t1ledxmtu,t31e9feuq,07/22/24 10:37,1,11,0,1,"""English and French ARE related. They are more distantly related than French is to other Romance languages or English to other Germanic languages, but they are still both Indo-European languages and have more in common than Mandarin and Japanese do. Furthermore, there is a lot ancient and recent of mutual influence between these two languages (the most obvious being all of the vocabulary English borrowed from French) but also from Germanic languages on French (the subject pronoun not being optional for example) and from Romance languages on English (a lot of the vocabulary that English did not borrow from French, it borrowed it from Latin directly). Sortie does not look like exit, but it looks like sortie, which is a borrowing from French to English with a more specific meaning in English than in French. Now for your main question, I cant think of a word that is the same in French and English but with a reversed order, but I wouldnt be surprised if there are. Edit : maybe first person object pronouns correspond to what youre looking for. The pronouns me in French and me English are etymologically related (although they are not pronounced the same) and mostly mean the same thing. But clitic pronouns are placed before the verb in French and after in English. Il me voit = he sees me"""
French,Hylencorp,t2fijur,t1leefx0g,t31e9feuq,07/22/24 12:17,0,3,0,0,"""You can make English sound more French or German. . Surprisingly, the word “exit” comes from Latin, ex-ire (out-go). Both of those stems exist in French: ex- is used as a prefix to words similar to English, and ire is the future tense of aller (i.e.: j’irai à la plage demain). You can make English more French. For example, for a similar concept to exit you can say “Departure” or “Departure Point”, both being of French origin (départ ou point de départ). Not exactly used in the context of exiting a building, but those are used in an airport or ship. Or you can choose to use more Germanic words instead (in England, most exit signs say “Way out”). Im not sure if comparing European languages to Mandarin or Japanese would be helpful. The writing system is entirely different. It’s like comparing apples to oranges."""

French,CocoJuTo,t2i5hghk5i,t1leftc0h,t31e9feuq,07/22/24 16:38,0,1,0,0,"""English is related to French though as 29% of the English vocabulary is derived from French. What you did was cherry picking examples but they are related especially in the ""upper class"" vocabulary such as beef/bœuf, pork/porc, joy/joie, parenthood/parenté, etc. BTW just saying but ""just"", ""related"" and ""similar"" are further words of French origin and mean exactly the same thing. Heck there are loads upon loads of words which are written the same way and mean the same thing. And if you count further vocab with latin origins, the grand total of romance in English is as high as 58%. Way before other germanic languages. And French also has loads of germanic words in it too and our grammar isn  this dissimilar as at the first glance. French also used to have accusative, dative, genitiv, etc with the related flections. They are just used differently nowadays but we still find the same logic which came throughout the times. And honestly, France, Germany and the UK are all neighbors so, of course, languages have influence on the neighbors. Especially a historical powerhouse such as France.  To some exceptions (Albanian, Hungarian and Finn), languages in Europe aren  in bubbles but rather are in a continuum."""
French,misaka-imouto-10032,t28k4kxpvo,t1lehakos,t31e9feuq,07/22/24 21:57,0,2,0,0,"""I don  know why I get recommended to this post by reddit, but here is something beyond French about Japanese and Chinese:. This phenomenon is called """" - most of which happened because they were not words but phrases composed with words that has meanings which does not create ambiguity when reversed, so either AB or BA form is used, in premodern Chinese. Over time, Japanese took Chinese loanwords and favoured BA as a fixed loanword. Finally, when the Chinese language modernise in the 1920s, AB is favoured, hence the difference. So I don  think similar phenomenon applies to English->French or vice versa, since such reversion never happened in either English or French - and when taking loan phrases, they take the whole phrase (e.g. aide-de-camp instead of ""camp-aid""; chewing-gum, no mâcher-gomme)"""

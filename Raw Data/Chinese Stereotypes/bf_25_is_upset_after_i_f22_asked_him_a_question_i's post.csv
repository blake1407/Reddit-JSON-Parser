Hello, I am currently in undergrad and I am dating an international student from India. For context I am Haitian American (I was was born in America from Haitian immigrants). In the beginning he was very sweet as he took me to a restaurant and gave me several gifts including an indian top when he went back home from winter break. However, after spending some time with him, hes been saying some questionable things like “theyre white rash” or “the Chinese look weird” etc. It got to the point I noticed he is very hateful person. I understand there are stereotypes and not everyone would like every ethnicity, but I never really find myself actively degrading another ethnicity, but he does. So yesterday, I showed him a pic of our new undergrad president and he said “who is this white rash” and honestly I kind of felt icky by that comment, not because I believe a certain race is pure, but I dont believe we should generalize every white person. I then told him, “ you dont like Chinese people or white people. Do you like black people?”. He said, “I like you right?”. Then I said “besides me” and he answered “ of course!” However afterwards,  I think he took offense to that and did not call me back after I called him.  I am confused if I did something wrong. Edit: so it seems like people feel as if I am somehow supporting/protecting white people. This is not true. White people, as we all know from history are far from saints. My problem is, as mentioned in my post, is that I find it quite odd that he hates supposedly everyone and not black people? I find it hard to believe that he says all these things about other races I’m supposed to believe that he loves black people? I highly doubt that. That’s my problem and that’s why I asked him that question. I am not supporting white people whatsoever. Tl;DR: my bf has said some questionable things about other people and i asked him if he likes black people. "

Its not acceptable to use racist slurs even when someone does fit a negative stereotype. There are slurs for poor people from every ethnic background and none of them are okay. Making fun of people because they are poor or you think they look weird isnt okay either. Theres no way to cut this and wind up with acceptable behavior. There really isnt. .

South Asians come in many colors, from quite white to blue-black (in fact, that’s the meaning of “Krishna.” Lord Krishna was supposed to have been “so black as to be blue.”) A Black African friend once told me that the darkest skinned people he’d ever seen were in South India.xa0xa0. xa0You’d think that would mean that Indians, Pakistanis, etc. would be totally colorblind, but no. South Asian culture is one of the most color-conscious, whiteness-worshipping cultures on earth. The Sanskrit word for ‘caste’ is ‘varna’ which means ‘color.’ People are so squeamish about dark skin that they paint Krishna as sky blue instead of the deep black our religious texts expressly tell us he’s supposed to be. Upper class/caste Indian people are almost always lighter skinned. Lower class/caste Indians are almost always darker skinned. Color consciousness runs through almost every area of life. You can’t go into any drugstore, department store, or corner store without seeing shelves of skin-lightening cream.xa0xa0. xa0Especially if your boyfriend is pretty dark, that anti-dark-skin propaganda would have been drummed into his head and heart since he was born. It was probably pretty satisfying and exciting to him to learn these American slurs for lighter skinned people and to hear all this Trumpy anti-Chinese stuff. It probably feels like hitting back against the color-based contempt he felt all his life. So his being negative about White people and light-skinned East Asians might be more like a Black person saying “honkey” than a White person using those slurs. But, quite frankly, he sounds like an immature, moody guy and not really worth your time.xa0"""

Im sure they still believe it but theyre at least too embarrassed to say it around me and I think theyre not as hateful about it.  When you grow up in a monoculture its easy to build absurd stereotypes. You need exposure to other races to humanize them. Of course there are cosmopolitan Indians especially in the younger generation who are much more liberal about race, but your boyfriend sounds like more or less all the older Indian immigrants I know. If Im being honest, he almost certainly has negative stereotypes against black people too. FWIW, Im not sure what gives me this vibe, but from what youve written I also have this feeling that he actually secretly fetishizes white and Chinese women and thats why hes constantly saying negative things about them for no reason -- its a way to kind of talk about the thing that is too taboo to talk about, while deflecting any suspicions of how he feels. This might be totally off base and hes just a garden variety racist. It doesnt matter. Hes racist trash. Just drop him."""

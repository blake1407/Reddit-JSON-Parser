Hello, I am currently in undergrad and I am dating an international masters student from India. For context I am Haitian American (I was was born in America from Haitian immigrants). In the beginning he was very sweet as he took me to a restaurant and gave me several gifts including an indian top when he went back home from winter break. However, after spending some time with him, hes been saying some questionable things like “theyre white rash” or “the Chinese look weird” etc. It got to the point I noticed he is very hateful person. I understand there are stereotypes and not everyone would like every ethnicity, but I never really find myself actively degrading another ethnicity, but he does. . So yesterday, I showed him a pic of our new undergrad president and he said “who is this white rash” and honestly I kind of felt icky by that comment, not because I believe a certain race is pure, but I dont believe we should generalize every white person. I then told him, “ you dont like Chinese people or white people. Do you like black people?”. He said, “I like you right?”. Then I said “besides me” and he answered “ of course!” However afterwards,  I think he took offense to that and did not call me back after I called him.  I am confused on if I did something wrong. Edit: so it seems like people feel as if I am somehow supporting/protecting white people. This is not true. White people, as we all know from history are far from saints. My problem is, as mentioned in my post, is that I find it quite odd that he hates supposedly everyone and not black people? I find it hard to believe that he says all these things about other races I’m supposed to believe that he loves black people? I highly doubt that. That’s my problem and that’s why I asked him that question. I am not supporting white people whatsoever."

It’s akin to you having a friend who gossips to you about another friend, most likely they are or will gossip about you too. If he’s bold enough to talk about the Chinese, he most likely will trash you as a black woman as well. I can totally imagine him saying something slick about black people in an angry moment. That’s my main concern. Now if he was just talking crap about white people, I get it, we all deal with the crushing weight of racism/white supremacy in this country, and it’s common to get frustrated. But that other talk lets me know that he’s capable of crossing the line to hate on you too. I’d strongly reconsider pursuing a relationship with this man for that alone."""

However, I’d take issue with comments against other minority groups because at the end of the day white supremacy hurts us all and we should support one another rather than tear each other down. In general, he does sound like a crappy person, so I’d end things due to that. Keep in mind, racism isn’t your problem to solve."""

Maybe there’s sth else there including anti-China propaganda spread in India/US through US propaganda channels. Many Chinese people also dislike Indians. He should know better though. . You mentioned also that he makes white ‘rash’ comments, there is a strong anti colonial justification for this term when brown and black people say it. I don’t consider it a racist term. It’s a classist term invented and perpetuated by white people to refer to the poor among them. It carries no weight when a brown or black person says it other than a passing insult or a warning to others in the community. I think black people don’t need to constantly protect white peoples’ feelings. Real white allies understand why brown and black people wouldn’t trust or like them in the first place. After all they pulled and still pull, trusting them blindly is a big mistake. In my opinion a brown person’s dislike of white people is never comparable to racism and definitely not comparable to anti black racism. He can’t be racist against a white person. He has no power for that. Now his dislike of Chinese people could come from a national rivalry and unresolved prejudice. It could show his biased views against minorities but it’s not necessarily the case."""

This is a culture of violence, domination and appropriation. This problem is systemic and white people always use racial solidarity with their fellow white people against us. They don’t need to be in the klan to be directly and indirectly racist and to feel and act entitled to all the power. Anyone who thinks they’re going to willingly give up the unearned privileges they have and share the power, is deadly wrong. It has never happened before in history. . They’ve trained the ones they colonised and enslaved to protect white people at all costs, including defending their hypothetical hurt feelings. To place their advocates in our minds. Now they’ve been telling us that black people can be racist towards white people -we are the worst racists, they say- and that we live in a post racial society.

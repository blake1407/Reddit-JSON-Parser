Ayurveda, the science of life is a long traditional alternative medicine system from the Indian subcontinent. This natural science is based on the fundamental laws of nature with therapeutic approach for treatment of innumerous human diseases. Aging represents a systematic involution of the human body and the brain is considered as the most vulnerable organ to this process. Therefore, to avoid this damage, the Rasayana therapy, a rejuvenation branch of Ayurvedic medicine was established. Various natural drugs that act as brain tonic, promote health of the brain, lead to the alleviation of behavioral disorders or improve memory impairment are utilized in Rasayana approach. Various memory enhancing and rejuvenating plants are used in Rasayana therapies, including: Acorus calamus, Bacopa monniera, Clitoria ternatea, Nardostachys jatamansi, Terminalia chebula and many others (Singh 2013). Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is based on the balance between health and disease. According to theory of TCM, healthy body is the body in the balance, on the other hand disharmony is not the cause of disease. The disease is caused by life style, influence of pathogens and various negative effects. However, the balance can be restored by herbal treatment. For over thousands of years, Chinese people have accumulated experiences in treatment, diagnosis, and disease prevention to create a whole theoretical system of medicine therapy. Herbal medicines with memory enhancing properties are also encompassed in the TCM. Between the plants used in TCM for memory improvement belong: Huperzia serrata, Ginkgo biloba, Panax ginseng, Camellia sinensis and other (Yan et al., 2007).

Flavonoid apigenin has potential to treat diseases like schizophrenia, depression, Alzheimers and Parkinsons. Apigenin, a substance found in parsley, thyme, chamomile and red pepper, improves neuron formation and strengthens the connections between brain cells, new lab research demonstrates. . . Emotional health and brain health are closely linked, and mental health is considered a central part of brain health. Mental illness can affect the brains chemistry and function, disrupting communication between neurons and neurotransmission. This can lead to problems with how the brain processes information, which can manifest in abnormal mood, thinking, perception, and behavior. Some studies have found that certain mental health conditions can increase the risk of developing dementia, including:. Depression: Can double the risk of developing dementia within two years, and may be linked to 4% of all dementia cases worldwide. Anxiety: Can increase the risk of developing dementia . Other factors that can impact brain health include:. Stress: Unsuccessful coping with stress can damage brain structure and function. When someone experiences mental stress, their adrenal glands produce too much cortisol, a chemical that helps the brain control emotions and moods. Too much cortisol can change brain chemistry and trigger symptoms of depression. Social connections: Strong social networks are associated with larger brain volume. Positive emotions: Can trigger ""reward"" pathways in the brain, which can lead to lasting activation of the ventral striatum. This activation has been linked to lower levels of stress hormones and other healthful changes in the body. . . Positive Emotions and Your Health. People who are emotionally well, experts say, have fewer negative emotions and are able to bounce back from difficulties faster. This quality is called resilience. Another sign of emotional wellness is being able to hold onto positive emotions longer and appreciate the good times. Developing a sense of meaning and purpose in life—and focusing on what’s important to you—also contributes to emotional wellness. . . How Do Thoughts and Emotions Affect Health?. Poorly-managed negative emotions are not good for your health. Negative attitudes and feelings of helplessness and hopelessness can create chronic stress, which upsets the bodys hormone balance, depletes the brain chemicals required for happiness, and damages the immune system. Chronic stress can actually decrease our lifespan. (Science has now identified that stress shortens our telomeres, the “end caps” of our DNA strands, which causes us to age more quickly.). Poorly managed or repressed anger (hostility) is also related to a slew of health conditions, such as hypertension (high blood pressure), cardiovascular disease, digestive disorders, and infection. Our ""negativity bias"" means that we spend too much time ruminating over the minor frustrations we experience—bad traffic or a disagreement with a loved one— and ignore the many chances we have to experience wonder, awe, and gratitude throughout the day. Positive emotions lead to emotional resilience. Positive emotions have a scientific purpose—to help the body recover from the ill effects of persistent negative emotions. Thus cultivating positivity over time can help us become more resilient in the face of crisis or stress. Emotional resilience is like a rubber band—no matter how far a resilient person is stretched or pulled by negative emotions, he or she has the ability to bounce back to his or her original state. . . Mind/Body Connection: How Your Emotions Affect Your Health. Path to Improved Health. There are ways to improve your emotional health. First, recognize your emotions and understand why you are having them. Sorting out the causes of sadness, stress, and anxiety in your life can help you manage your emotional health. Following are some other helpful tips. 1. Express your feelings in appropriate ways.  2. Live a balanced life.  3. Develop resilience.  4. Calm your mind and body.  5. Take care of yourself. . . Protect your brain from stress. Stress management may reduce health problems linked to stress, which include cognitive problems and a higher risk for Alzheimers disease and dementia. . . How Brain Development Affects Children’s Mental Health. How Toxic Stress Alters Brain Development. Toxic stress, as mentioned before, refers to stress that is extreme, chronic, and/or prolonged without proper support. Toxic stress is often associated with what are called Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE). These can include abuse, neglect, violence towards others in the household, mental illness in the household, divorce, and incarcerated family member, or any other situation that causes extreme, chronic, or prolonged stress. In cases of toxic stress, the body is almost in a constant state of stress, which interrupts regular development by causing a decrease in connections between neurons and synapses. As mentioned before, some deterioration of synapses is completely normal and to be expected during development, however, problems can occur when too many of the brain’s synapses are lost. Without these synapses, essentially there is no connection within the brain to promote specific behaviors. Thus, things that should come naturally no longer do. In addition to a lack of connections, some cases, also show a permanent increase in stress hormone levels. . . . Mental Health and Sleep. Mental health impacts thoughts, feelings, and actions and influences our ability to handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Quality sleep is crucial for good mental health, but sleep issues can worsen mental health conditions, and mental health problems can lead to poor sleep. Adhering to sleep hygiene practices can improve sleep quality and mental well-being. . . Stressed out? Discover the effect of stress on the brain and ways to manage it.

Empathy and resilience to manage stress. Having empathy can help you manage stress by seeing other perspectives and communicating about how you feel.

Developing resilience can help you bounce back from stressful situations. You can develop resilience through positive thinking, developing problem-solving skills and having a strong support network. Consider the Greatest Generation, known for their resilience because they lived through World War II, the Great Depression and many more challenging times. Consider another scenario, where encouragement and support from your manager to find a solution to a difficult situation at work can minimize or even remove your stress. . .

Im Sarah and I am a Counselling Psychology doctoral student at the University of Roehampton. I am currently doing research on British-born Chinese peoples experiences of therapy in the UK and am looking to recruit participants for an online interview. For further details, please see my research Instagram page here - . As a British-born Chinese person myself, I see how there is very little research or awareness of our needs and experiences in therapeutic practice. I aim to contribute towards the very small amount of research that is currently available on BBC people and hopefully inform practice. If you are interested or if you have any questions, please do feel free to message me either on Facebook or on my research Instagram page above or you can email me on macs you for your consideration."

Ive had this exact dilemma for so long that its gotten to a point where ive progressed past the very basics of each language and can read/form basic sentences now. I know hiragana, katakana and some basic grammar for Japanese, and I know pinyin, basic grammar and some basic hanzi for Mandarin. . For a while I thought that I should learn both at the same time but plenty of people on reddit advise heavily against it so ive just been ""dropping"" one language, going to the next and having the cycle repeat. For context I live in a part of Australia where I regularly meet Chinese people (most of whom speak mandarin). We even have several Chinatowns so communication and finding people to speak to wouldn  be an issue. Ive also been interested in the history for some time and Its known to be a good language for business - particularly in this country. However  . Ive always been heavily interested in Japanese culture and regularly consume media in Japanese whether it be in the form of music, shows or games. I can definitely see myself using the Japanese side of the internet more even if were just talking about internet chat forums and discord communities. . Im stuck between learning Japanese and immersing myself in a language Ive always wanted to learn with media that I already love to consume on a daily basis, or learning a language that would be more ""practical"" for me and that I can use to communicate with in real life. I guess Japanese would be online and Mandarin would be offline in this sense. I know that Id enjoy learning both and wish that I could just study both at the same time but I don  think thats a good idea so I hope to find some clarity. "

But in this case, I’d say the walls are about equally high—we usually just hit it a lot sooner with Japanese. The advice about studying only one language at a time, while prudent, really depends on the languages and the learner. I, personally find Japanese and Chinese different enough that they don’t conflict in my memory, yet similar enough that they help me remember the other. Often I can guess a Chinese word that I never heard based on a Japanese word (sometimes the word I come up with is nonsense, but occasionally it can help in a pinch). If your biggest impediment is that always find yourself wishing you were learning the other one, why not try developing a study plan that incorporates both? Mornings are Chinese, evenings are Japanese, or alternating days/weeks. I say play with it, especially since you’ve already learned the basics of both. It requires more study time, and the path to fluency will be longer, but you sound pretty determined to learn both."""
thisorthatlanguage,ElderPoet,t210o5a8,t1laebk3o,t31dojyks,06/26/24 14:01,0,3,0,0,"""Two thoughts here. First, if its the advice of redditors that is putting you off learning both languages at once -- Im not going to say ignore that advice, because there are a lot of experienced language learners here. What I am going to say is that everyone learns differently, at least to some extent, and what doesn  work for one person may work for another. Its worth trying to see if it works for you. (My own first experience with two at once was Russian and German in college. Like you, Id taught myself some elements of both languages already, and for the most part it was not a problem.). Second, if it turns out that the both-at-once approach doesn  work for you, thats fine -- youve learned something about your language learning style. Then youll need to go to Plan B and pick which one to dive into first. Personally I think in your place Id go for Japanese, since you have the enthusiasm for it. A bonus will be that as you learn kanji, youll be giving yourself a head start in reading Mandarin. Corollary to the second thought: If youre like me (and my sympathies if you are), if it turns out you need to adopt Plan B, a few weeks or months in youll be thinking, ""Eh, this isn  so much fun, maybe I should have started with other language instead, maybe I should go back and do that."" You probably know this already, but -- resist that urge and push on. Thats just Ol Deadly Sin Number Seven, our old frenemy Sloth, doing what Sloth does."""

Since you mentioned the use of force, did you forget what the Japanese did during World War II? They killed more than 35 million people! also you only read it partly about the Chinese governments stance on the Taiwan issue. The original claim is: ""We don  rule out using force to unite Taiwan if Taiwan independence insists on spliting our country.""  . Lastly, my point is that you can  decide which language to learn based solely on your opinion about the use of force."""

I haven’t met any “?Japanese aunties”?. As for Japanese, there might be some students in your town who want to practice English with a native speaker. That’s where you could chitchat with them. . I am currently low-key learning Chinese, but I am also a heavy Japanese media consumer. I would actually maybe take Japanese first. . Many elementary kanji in Japanese are also in Chinese. Maybe you can use the time to learn strokes, so then you can learn hanzi strokes and Chinese hanzi won’t be as scary."""

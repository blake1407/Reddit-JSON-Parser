Im genuinely dissapointed that some of the people are defending him in Communism101,but thats another story and its not related to the post."

Sorry if I knew you were an ultra I wouldn’t have engaged. Come back when you grow up. You literally are a child throwing their toys out of the cot because you’re angry about “nooooo China bad!!”. Either say your point clearly or go away"""

Do you understand how to think dialectically? China has been under so much external pressure that they had the option of bending or breaking. If you’re an ultra left and you’d rather see socialist projects collapse rather than adjust to survive while still building socialism (which the PRC undoubtedly are) then that’s another story. But if you understand that it was required for them to not collapse under economic and geopolitical pressure and added on to that a full blown propaganda war, then we can talk"""

Their relationship actually cooled down during Bolsonaros rule and one of Lulas foreign policy goals was to improve ties with China again. Lula met with Xi last month!. Its clear that they will trade with a country no matter what leader they chose, but it does seem they clearly favour a guy like Lula."""

Instead of supporting communist movements he is actually supporting the reactionaries. China is gonna fall under him. Mark my words."""

Do you have knowledge and understanding of the Century of Humiliation that they want to prevent while Xi was known to come to Iowa in 1985. How do you know he betrayed Mao? Because the Cultural Revolution was perceived to be a failure?  Did you know hes on his third term? . It just seems youre lost,  dazed,  and confused,  youve come to a conclusion and facts wont sway you while only interested in the conclusions youve come to. . So what do you know about China and its socialism? What do you know about Chairman Xi to comment?  And what do you know about the party that is assisting in allowing the Chinese people to improve their lives and conditions?"""

But even this fails to meet the moment. . Maoists are prepared to support the Chinese proletariat if it ever chooses to “bombard the headquarters”. But that doesn’t mean we wouldn’t also be happy with an anti-revisionist movement within the CPC itself, which would require cliques to form to the Left of Xi."""

It makes no sense to take your hostility out on others,  that merely makes it clear that youve gained little in terms of understanding the issue you put forth. . You are failing to understand how Xi and the Communist Party of China are losing favor in China and how you came to that conclusion. . Until you can present people with an understanding of your reasoning,  they wont be able to see anything but the anger you bring about.  That helps no one."""

I dont think you know shit about China, in fact youre closer to a reactionary than Xi ever could be.

Not even in the most favorable liberal projections. It’s just propaganda. Some state officials are millionaires. Most are not. Far less than in the U.S. Since Deng’s “Reform and Opening Up” period the wages of the Chinese worker have increased a hundred fold. The last forty years in China have witnessed the most rapid development of productive forces in any country anywhere in human history. . Deng and the CPC correctly understood that the ultraleft line of the Gang of Four that it was better to be poor and socialist than rich and capitalist was wrong. Fundamentally stupid and alienating to the proletariat. They want a rich socialist society. Not a poor strangled sanctioned backwards one. . Good for them, too. It’s working."""

I mean, China is growing economically and condition of its people are improving but this is something that can as well be said about capitalist countries. . China is doing all this with little to none social security while state officials are milionaries. This in itself is wrong. China has economic inequalities at similar levels to United States. . Chinese government sure doesnt look like a socialist government right now, it looks like a government that pretends to be socialist as a way to stay in power"""

Especially as a Marxist Leninist why would you support such a revisionist line then the ussr during the Lenin and Stalin era rejected.

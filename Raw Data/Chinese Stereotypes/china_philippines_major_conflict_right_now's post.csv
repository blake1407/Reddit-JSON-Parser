First and foremost, I am not sure if this is the perfect platform/community to share this statement from me and thousands of filipinos at my back. We sincerely say, we want and need China more than USA! and we dont want war. There are still millions of filipinos think this way, our friendship and benefits vice versa is bigger to any countries. USA is just feeding phil as a trap to have conflict with China., Again we Filipinos cant afford war. China has been a bigger brother to us more then USA who once betrayed conquered us not China. We treat china and chinese people out brother and sisters. We want peace  "

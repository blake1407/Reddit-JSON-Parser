Start   to actually help the citizens of the state to bring back jobs to help the homeless get back on thier feet. Dont give them money and reward them for doing nothing . Close the damn border until there are enough good jobs for the people we already have here. Have the  electric companies all pay to upgrade the electrical grid and infrastructure because they are making a profit from it. ( not from our tax dollars) Unless you plan on selling electricity to the electric companies. . That there shouldn  be any type of flex alert BS. That gives them an excuse to charge people more. Because if they do charge people more at that time , 100% of extra charge profits, should go to  upgrading the grid. So that Flex alerts wont happen again . and also to make sure the grid is able to handle 4 electric cars charging with every house in California all charging at the same time during the hottest day of the year with out a flex alert or charging people extra.   Once you can manage that then I would say that California is ready to stop sell gas cars, and not before then. . Because its infair for monoplized electric companies just make a profit from and americans holding them hostage to pay what ever they say. Because there is no other option or competition  to get a cheaper price. . Plus How can you mandate something that in the united states we dont even produce any of the parts or batteries here in the United States. Which you are mandating us to give our money only to profit other countries. Which Im sure someone can contest that fact is against our costitution and our freedom of choice. . Also a similar situation is mandating solar to be installed on every new building construction. Which is even worse, as Not a single solar cell is made in the USA because the EPA wont allow it because they are toxic to make. so not only are you mandating making another country rich, but your also mandating an increase the manufacturing of toxic products with no other options to the american people   . Thats totally illogical, unconstitutional and unethical. There are hundreds of different ways to produce electricity. That doesn  involve mandating us to send our money making us poor and to enrichen another country. That also its manufacturing and unregulated disposal of toxic chemicals in another county. Isnt even close to the ""Green "" idea California is intending to promote its philosophy and ideas to others . . Infact its completely opposite  along with forcing americans to give thier money to another country to make everyone more poor as less money in USA in circulation. Inorder to own a new home and transportation which is  basically a requirement to  live in California. . That  you  are  acting  a totalitarian govenment taking away each and every Americans right to choose their own options from within the USA. That if there isnt an options here, then it is unconstitutional to mandate something thats not available from within the state. . You might as well say you are mandating all building materials must be made with asbestos which asbestos materials are not made in the United States either but you might as well mandate that too as its bad just the same as a solar cell is bad for the environment and us too might as well.  because I don  see the difference. . in order to make a good for the mini the few IE companies are going to have to take a hit. think of it as the game Monopoly what happens at the end only one or two players at the end play forever and everybody elses bankrupt and thats our future if nothing changes. except for now you made it worse because you threw China in the mix and they don  have to follow the rules of the game to jump in and out anytime they want to and don  have to pay any of the fees and don  go to jail and just benefit just from everyone elses who has to follow the rules. thatll inadvertently end up trying to win the game and own us all which is also a national security threat and should not be allowed because its unconstitutional to mandate giving money to a country who is unregulated. Doesn  pay taxes, Doesn  follow the same rules, to environment , human,child animal,political, financial, employee, commerce, and any other laws that we have mandated upon ourselves. But for some reason we will allow a foreign l entity that its not a citizen, to create a corporation that make it a citizen in the US that allows them to interfere with our politics,, to influence politicians to mandate laws to force the people of that country to buy products only they sell to make them richer. if those people want to own a new home. Which ultimately make  those people poorer.So that it make it easier and easier for  them to buy every asset from that country. leaving the people witg very little while they continue to buy and own everything. That they can also manipulate and control  the people after they have the government in their pocket. Along with all the other corporations as they have no choice to go along because almost all of thier products also come from  that same country, that if they dont  they wont recieve products to make a profit. Then they can control the people through television and media. That if the people dont agree or want to go to war against them . All they have to do is nothing, and send them nothing, which they have become so dependent that stopping 90% of consumer products,medications, clothes, sanitary, and even food that comes from them.  The people will be fighting against each other for many of the things they need just to survive when those products stop coming.That the people wont be able to become organized enough to go to war against another countries government that continues to  control and eventually own everything within that country. Just the same as they own everything within their country the same. Because If they also stop buying assets from that country, and they just continue to hold all of the money it continues to receive for thier goods. It will also devistate thier economy, forcing them to print more money for circulation which will cause more inflation that eventually ends up in the government seeking to control them. That again if they refuse to sell assets to that government they can just stop all goods to that country and completely wipe out the stock maket. . Which technically  they  will have that countries people, government, and corporations by the balls. So if anybody who does business with such a government or any politicians who abridged them in those aspects in their efforts to own and control the United States should be charged with treason.  which I believe the consequence for treason is death by rope. . Because whats going to stop a government such as that ,  from doing exactly those steps and actions almost exactly as I have just given . As they don  have anything to lose, no consequences for their actions, and frankly no opposition to them either ( not without making the people fight for resources and companies to go bankrupt,and destroy their economy). . Which If you havent figured out its Chinas playbook for taking over the USA from within. without having to fire a single bullet. . That they are using our system against us without them having to follow the same rules. Only because our companies and politician have let them from the money we have given them. That  they control and have exploited their own people to do so.  Which  if they are allowed to continue this path . Every Americans fate will end up the same as all the Chinese people that their government has exploted upon them. . So I will ask a question to every amarican. Are you dumb or smart?. . If your smart, if you take your own advice.  Which if your actions don  follow the answers you give to these questions. Means that you are not!. If you see someone doing something that is allowed to do things that normally have severe consequences. Or you dont agree of thier actions how they force people and childern to work for  them in poor conditions to long hours for little to no money. That also have no care to how they dispose of toxic chemicals or regard to thier effects upon the environment or people. Who regulate and control all news sources and silence any information that they do not  like, or want anyone to hear.That all the companies are ran, overseen, and essentially owned by that government. That thier people are not allowed to watch, leave the  country, or even own a penny of another countries currency let alone land.  As it it all owned by that government. . That if you had the choice, would  you look the otherway, and give them money as long as you got what you wanted for less? ( meaning you don  care how they got it, with no regard for human or animal life, environment, oppression, forced labor or dont want to know that someone might have died in the process of making whatever you decied to buy). . Or would you want to know how it got to you and nobody suffered as a result buying whatever it is?. . Answer those questions, and  only your actions that follows your answer will determine if you are smart or not. Then if you are smart.  what do you think will happen if people choose to fund or give money to the ones who have no regard or consequences for their actions?. You think they will get more or less powerful?. That also what do you think happens if people just choose to look away and do nothing when they bad people who continue to do things to others  you don  approve and who don  have to worry about any consequences. What do you think will happen if those bad people choose to do the same to you?Do you expect someone to help you. How could  you when you chose not to help someone else who was in the  same position you are now? . . Although we may not be able to do something in that moment. But  its our actions towards them after that fact that can change all of our futures to come.  That choosing to look away from something we would not like done upon ourselves or friends and family. Only increases the likelihood that it will inevitably happen to you or those you care about. Especially if you continue to give money to fund those things that you do not approve that they only will continue to gain power and will only increase that type of oppression  further and further as long as it continues to give them more and more power over everything. . So what do you think the smartest choice is? To keep giving them more money and power.  or to stop???. .  Choose how you wish your future and next generations lives will be or how it will be controlled.  the choice is yours and everyone  around you.  Do you look away and decided not to tell anyone, or do you tell everyone you can to inform them if they continue to also look away. If everyone chooses to look away, they are only looking away from the same fate that they too will eventually have. . Remember 2008. .   . "

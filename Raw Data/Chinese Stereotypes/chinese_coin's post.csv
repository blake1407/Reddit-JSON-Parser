With that being said I could really use some help.  I was out in an old gold mine that turned into a ghost town. Many Chinese people sailed over to make a living for their families. I was looking at the rubble and I found something that look like an old Chinese coin/token (I dont know the difference so if you do, please let me know!). It looks like theres Chinese characters on it but l could be wrong. Sorry if the pictures are terrible. "

The character outlined is called “tong” and would be paired to the right with “bao” opposite the square hole. Without the emperor, it is unlikely you’ll ever get a good idea of when it was made. . That being said, the alloy appears wrong and the metal appears unusually brittle. The most likely origin of this coin is a local Indonesian copy of a Chinese coin. At the time, Indonesia relied heavily on trade with china to earn currency to circulate nationally. However, as trade declined, they ran out of real Chinese coins and had to create lookalikes of worse quality to make up for it. This coin is likely over 100+ years old, and is actually more rare than the Chinese coin it was copied from."""

Im no expert on Chinese coins but this looks pretty typical for what their designs looked like (obviously yours is broken) but they all would’ve had that hole in the middle which was usually square shaped which you can see, and the letters look right. Also if you were curious they made so many they weren’t even really worth faking unless it was a really rare coin. The coin is super cool and it also has a cool story behind it! Congrats on the awesome find!"""

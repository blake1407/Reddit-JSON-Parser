I have been working in a place where there are a lot of chinese people and absolutely learn the language and i know some chinese and some of my chinese friends know hindi, i see i cant find a resource for chinese people outside china to learn hindi, as my friends are keen to learn but their english is just okay. so last week i spent some time and made a video that they really liked, which is ""learning hindi in chinese"". i wanna get some feedback from chinese peoples on how this video sounds to you and if anything can help before i make 20 more parts. youtube link:  . thankyou"

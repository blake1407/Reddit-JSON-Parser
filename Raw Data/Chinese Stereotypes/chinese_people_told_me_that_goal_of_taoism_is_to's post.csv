But if all those were solved, and all we had to do was play. What is most fun? What do we do? This is the new emergency, the new emergent situation. And perhaps an idea that we have placed ourselves here in order to ""have to"" strive.

But it cant be because to be aware of anything there must be the apprehension of difference. Even if it is just the difference between you and your apprehension of yourself. So we are these beings that think they have something to do but any goal we would want to achieve is already done. Or rather, if we could know why we want to achieve certain things then we would know that the underlying condition we wish to bring about already obtains. Yet because of that very condition itself-the Tao-we have this limited perspective and are striving. I heard from Advaita people that the striving is sweeter than the attainment.

However, I understand mysticism in general, and I would include Taoism in this - to be concerned with practices that help the seeker to see past the artifice of the thinking mind and the conceptual layers of interpretation with which we see the world and the self. It is common, after these layers have been seen through, to realize that identification as a finite being or a brain in a body was illusory and the truth is that there are not really separate entities, or that such entities who think they are separate are only temporarily confused. . While what I described isn  directly discussed in the philosophical Taoist works - the insights apparent in those works seem to me to come from individuals who have realized some level of this type of realization of ""no self"" as is said in Buddhism or ""non-duality"" as in Advaita. . I do think that type of realization is the closest anyone could come to ""immortality"" - however, its not as if anything is gained - because its not as if any of our existences are any different. If that insight is true its true for all of us. It is funny to think of it as immortality, though, because for the ego its more like death. Sufi mystics call it Fanaa or Annihilation. Nirvana means ""blown out"" like a flame. .

This was a cultural and philosophical response to the surge in popularity with Confucianism at the time (500 BCE). After this, Taosim got popular in china and began to mix its ideas more heavily with local folk beliefs, aesthetic interpretations, and cultural movements. This lead to a a couple of thousands of years of whats called  raditional taoism.  This form of taoism involves heros and myths that fundamentally changed how one should act. After 1000 years of mystics and scholars interpreting these things, a case law or standard of interpretation emerged that was very different from philosophical taoism. Basically, similarly to Zen, one could reach a good reward by being an genius expert in a skill or craft. One of these rewards was a elixer of immortality crafted by experts like these.

We are usually in samsara, where we view time as a linear process with past and future. But we can enter nirvana with enough understanding of the dharma and reform our perception of time, where the present is the only time that exists. If you live purely in the present, death is not a possibility anymore, the source of all suffering (fear of death) thus also ceases to exist. . Ive not heard this echoed in taoist circles, but buddhism and taoism certainly greatly influenced each other. They both originated around 500 years BCE and the culture from which they both arose already had semblences of these concepts. Not to mention the 2500 years the philosophies had to influence each other and split into multiple branches. One way in which this happened was through the buddhist monk Sengzhao/Seng-Chao, who lived 4th century CE. He shaped the Madhyamika school and connected a lot of buddhist and taoist concepts with each other. One of the more important aspects I remember from his teachings says that nirvana and samsara are the same thing, just two different perspectives of it. Tao is another term for it, trying to capture the highest principle of reality more broadly, with less emphasis on how to escape suffering and so on. Therefore it could be argued that taoists who practice and coalesce with the tao do reach states of nirvana and thus immortality all the same."""

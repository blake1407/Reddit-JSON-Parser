WarshipPorn,TenguBlade,t23ww3zgq,t1lbnaq8d,t1lbkstkn,07/04/24 16:17,1,18,0,0,"""They are really pushing the sea trial routine. Considering Fujian was noticeably more outfitted by the time of her first sea trial than Shandong or Liaoning, and there’s been no indication any major issues were encountered on previous trials, this is not a surprising or abnormal rate of testing activity, not even by international standard.  A 3-week turnaround between trials is around what previous Chinese carriers were also making if they didn’t require any outfitting work. Liaoning had a gap of about 3 months between her first and second trial while additional antennas and deck equipment were installed, but her second through eighth sea trials were conducted in just under 7 months: she departed for her 2nd trial on 11/29/2011, and returned from her 7th on 6/21/2012. With an average duration of ~7 days per trial, that would also require her to turn around every 3-ish weeks like Fujian is. Shandong likewise spent the 3 months between her first and second trials receiving additional fit-out equipment, like deck edge antennas, and the 1.5 months between her second and third trial saw major work being done to the arresting gear.  The turnaround time between her 3rd, 4th, and 5th trials were also about 3 weeks - after which she took another 3-month pause to have her deck markings painted and UNREP equipment installed.  There’s no indication of any new equipment being added after her 6th trial, but again, her 7th, 8th, and final sea trials also all started about a month apart, which means ~3 week turnaround time. Lastly, as a non-Chinese point of comparison, Gerald R. Ford was also averaging a turnaround of ~3-4 weeks between later ISEs, when she was no longer requiring major work between every event."""

WarshipPorn,HerrQuattro,t28ujdccg,t1lbpdp23,t1lbpb7ic,,1,11,0,0,"""There is currently no carrier under construction, sure… but that doesn’t mean it isn’t under active development. They are taking lessons learned from the development of the Fujian to integrate into the Type 004. The PLAN has not indicated whatsoever that they have plans of building a second Type 003. And if they had, no doubt we would’ve seen evidence of it years ago. It’s not like they don’t have the shipbuilding capacity. However, the PLAN has indicated that they fully intend to build nuclear powered aircraft carriers. They have been doing this for the past 50 years. They purchased ex-HMS Melbourne to “scrap” in the 1970s, which is rumored to not have been finally broken up until the 90s. They then bought 2 Kiev-class “carriers” from Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union to “turn into theme parks” (which I think they did do, Kiev was turned into a hotel tho Minsk is currently abandoned). No doubt after being thoroughly studied. Then they bought ex-Varyag thru a shell corporation to be turned into a casino, and then studied and rebuilt it into the Liaoning over the course of like 14 years. Took the lessons of rebuilding the Liaoning and built the Shandong on a modified/improved design, and now took the lessons of the Shandong to build their own in-house design- Fujian. China has been incrementally building its carrier knowledge for the past 50 years, with each ship becoming larger and more advanced, and if you think they’re stopping now, you are deeply mistaken. They clearly want to match the threat of the USN."""

Well, I am not going to discuss China with you because you are obviously bias on this matter. Poisoned by propaganda you are. Lets get back to carriers. Nuclear carriers have their merits. I never dismissed that. They can carry more ammo, more fuel and more planes than traditional carrier. On the other hand, they have a higher operation cost. So it is never a one sided game. In operation level, they also have certain advantage such as no need to refuel so they have a considerable longer operation range. It is useful if your country have a desire to dominate oversea countries by military force. Greatest tool to suppress democracy and freedom. In teams of show of force, this is even more effective than nuclear weapons. On the other hand, if you are not aiming for global dominance, nuclear carrier doesnt have a significant advantage over traditional one. As I mentioned before, your crew and your escort all need to be refueled. It is obvious you cannot offer any counter statement on this argument so you switch to a more brainless approach: Attacking China to solve every problem. The fact is, NO warship can fight forever.

I recently downloaded Weibo to get an impression of chinese social media. I scrolled a bit through it and saw a very shocking video. There was a dog leashed at the back of a car and the car drove. The dog had bloody legs and was completely defenseless. It was horrible to look at. I always thought Chinese social media very strictly managed but this one caught me completely off-guard. . I read through comments and from what I could understand, the people had the same reaction as me. They were shocked. One person even made out the plate on the car and recommended to contact something like a Public Security Bureau of the respective province. Another one said there should be way more laws implemented to prevent those things. My question: Is it really true that many chinese people are so unhinged? . I live in Germany and never ever would someone be able to do this. Not only from a law reinforcement perspective but also regarding the moral of society. . Are there specific reasons for them to do that? . Im open to learn more things about chinese society. "

But I think a lot of it is just cherrypicking to make them look bad. And Im still glad that its generally very normal as well."""
AskAChinese,HansSoban,t265k2i807,t1lcsf0yp,t31e13w3b,07/12/24 00:43,1,3,0,1,"""Chinese people are normal people as well as the others. Actually because of the agricultural tradition, Chinese people interact and intergrate animals and livestock into their life pretty well. Dogs and cats as well as ox, house, donkey etc. plays an important role in our daily living and works, we normal people treats them as a part of the family, includes medical support and a certain level of bereavement, even a funeral if the financial condition allows. . While I believe love happens a lot in other countries as well, animal abuse happens samely as a normality in our time, as no place can manage to deliver perfect social education to every single individual. In the future if you see any of those content, please do not hesitate to file a report to the certian media platform, they will take care of it."""

In fact, I know that it does exist in extreme forms in western countries. Only because it also exists in western countries doesnt make it less cruel. This doesnt answer my question too. Sure it does happen in western countries but how they deal with it differs a lot from country to country. I was just asking how they deal with that in China because I just want to know. Dont put me in a light that allegedly I dont like China."""

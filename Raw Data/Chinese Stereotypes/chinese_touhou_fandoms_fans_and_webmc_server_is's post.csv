At first of all:Im a touhou fan from China,recently in Chinese touhou fandom,some guys that is Chinese people but in US is attacking touhou fandom Only in China,include the THBwiki in China,Minecraft Gensokyo server and Miao Yu Dian BBS which is a Chinese Touhou forum,and many touhou websites.Because they are in US so we can  just go find the police,They are even attacking non-touhou related websites like NGA player communities. Their reason is to attack Jiong Xian,but they are not only just attacking him,I don  think that is really why are they doing this. currently Chinese touhou fans are trying to public these details and trying to fight back or something,but anyone do that get banned quick by reports from these people,or get ""Esued"" Which means get doxxed or uhh i got bad english,cyber-attacked?,and get posted on their telegram. They have two Youtube Channel which called ""TV""which means anti-vtuber tv. ,if only look at the youtube it wasn  so Touhou-Related,but if you look at their telegram channel and chats which is attouhoutv , you can see many their operations on it,this whole thing is going really bad that we can  even browse the touhou wiki and enjoy some comics things,because it was all shutdown by these guys,so Chinese Touhou Fandom really needs some help. you can see more details on Chinese Bilibili a video website that like niconico website by searching """",and searching the  and  in Baidu tieba or look at their telegram,there will be more informations, thanks for everyone,also,Im new to reddit,I don  know is this flair good,if its not,please remind me."

Mr.Jiong has done a lot of dirty things, including attacking people he doesn  like through online violence (he calls it ""maintaining the purity of the Touhou""), inciting hatred between circles, etc. He is definitely not innocent."""

Is he a controversial person there? I dont understand why people are attacking him and other Chinese Touhou fans, but it all sounds very petty. I think you are probably right, though. The harassers must hate both Jiong Xian and Touhou fans in general if they are going this far."""

Ive been trying to access it for a few days now and have been wondering why its down. Thank you for informing us. Im so sorry to hear that the Chinese Touhou fandom is under attack, thats awful! Does this group leading the cyber-attack just hate Touhou fans, or something?. In any case, I hope everything calms down soon. :("""

I wonder if this has anything to do with Hololive testing the waters in CN market with appearances on bilibili (I think it was Kobo). . It’s crazy if they do tho and in such case I think some online flame war can break out there. Hololive and Touhou are both strong and tight communities, and The antis are pretty toxic and affecting people’s view on CN netizens. More context for the suspect relation: one of the biggest vtubers from Hololive, Shirakami Fubuki, was super popular in CN years ago. She is also a huge Touhou fan, singing Suika’s Japanese Goblin and had an interview with Mario Beat and ZUN himself."""

shanghai,supercubansandwich,t2x5y5e,t1lcejn91,t31dzatfa,07/09/24 16:05,1,2,0,3,"""I am 180cm/80kg. I had trouble finding clothes but eventually I figured it out. US and EU brands had my sizes, but it some stores the sizes are adjusted for Asia. So if you’re an XL back home you might find you’re an XXL in the same brand in China. Be sure to use the fitting rooms. Malls are good for this. Brands I shopped for that had average priced clothing in my size were Abercrombie, American Eagle, Nike, adidas, Reebok, Puma,H&M, Uniqlo, Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger. . Also, taobao can be a good resource. Many taobao shops will show measurement tables to allow customers to navigate the sizes. Be sure to get professionally measured. Sizing across all the sellers varies widely. I found shops that fit well where I was an L, and then another shop had good clothes for me in XXXL. Shops tend to sell similar clothing brands, so once you find a shop that seems to fit your style and sizing, be sure to save it. Taobao also will give you a wider selection of Western brands mentioned previously.  Definitely have someone show you how to return clothes so you do not feel like you’re taking a risk with every online purchase. . Lastly there is custom made clothing. You can go down to the fabric market and have stuff made. The only issue I encountered was that these stores tend to err on the side of being too small. Try to get a recommendation from a similarly sized person if you can. I didn’t go this route much. . However, I still ended up doing most of my shopping back home. It’s a lot cheaper and there is far more selection."""

In China, people buy clothes from e-commerce platform on JD.com, Taobao or PingDuoDuo. There should be dedicated shop for large size cloth for you. You should not have difficulty finding XXXXL size. Some of the tailor shop offer custom made and should still be cheaper than those in Europe."""

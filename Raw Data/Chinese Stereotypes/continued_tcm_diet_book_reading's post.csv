Ive been talking not about what to eat but about understanding who is eating and how to be people-oriented. For students of Houpu, this statement is not unfamiliar: always stay self-aware, always stay conscious, and always keep your awareness and perception clear. What is self-awareness? Its about understanding your ethnic group, race, and dietary habits on a conscious level, which requires learning. But as Ive mentioned, cats and dogs have never taken a class, so why do they live happily and fulfil their lifespan?. We often think that cats and dogs lack awareness, but thats wrong! Cats communicate with each other, and I even believe that ancient people could communicate with various animals. Ancient shamans could communicate with animals, and its said that when the Yellow Emperor fought Chiyou, he used various animals, including pandas. Since he could command animals, he must have been able to communicate with them. My wife told me a story: a man loved cats very much. He made cat food shaped like mice and birds for his cat. The cat food was tasty, but the cat just sniffed it, looked at it, and didn  eat it. The man was puzzled, thinking: Ive been so good to you, why don  you love me? We often have this kind of problem. So he found someone who understood cat language to ask the cat. After communicating, the person said the cat mentioned that its mother had told it not to touch red things. So when it saw red meat or mushroom-like food, it thought it was bad and wouldn  eat it. Since the man liked red, he had coloured all the cat food red, and the cat remembered its mothers words so it wouldn  eat. Once he dyed the cat food grey, the cat ate it. This shows that animals also have inherited awareness. When I talk about always staying self-aware, think about the education you received from your parents and grandparents growing up. Many of their experiences are valuable. Don  dismiss them just because they are not scientists or don  understand science. When I was young, I knew that crispy rice, baked buns, and scorched rice could help with digestion. Later in medical school, I learned that traditional Chinese medicine also says the same. This is what it means to stay self-aware. We also need to get rid of the inferiority complex of Chinese people. When foreigners point out our flaws, we immediately feel inadequate and think our ancestors were foolish, denying ourselves and following others. Over the years, weve experienced many things: one moment, were told lard is bad and switch to blended oil; then blended oil is said to be bad, so we switch to olive oilâ€¦ As soon as olive oil is mentioned, we feel superior to a Mediterranean diet but we still encounter problems. Therefore, now Chinese people are paying a high ""inferiority tax"" without any logical basis."

Ive spent a lot of time substantiating Chinese Medicine in terms of Western thought and Modern research only to discover that people will still not listen anyway. Whats more, all this explaining of Chinese Medicine reduces it and turns it into a pseudo of something else. We should go beyond this, but how? These days, I just look for peace."""

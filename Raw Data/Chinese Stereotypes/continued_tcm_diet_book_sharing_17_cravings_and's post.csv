Why do you eat? Its obviously to satisfy hunger and fill your stomach. The taste doesn  really matter. However, if you order dishes you like, it might be because youre hungry and craving that specific food. Truly satisfying foods have a special charm. Its important to know what youre craving and to cherish yourself. Always leave a small space or reserve for when youre craving something, so you can satisfy that craving. This is the best way to love yourself. My sister loves beer. Every time someone pours her a beer, she makes a satisfied ""sizzle"" sound. Thats what happiness is. My father also loves drinking, but I never had a taste for alcohol. Even though I can drink a lot—up to half a kg of 56-degree rice wine—Ive never found it appealing or craved it. Some people love eating chicken feet, duck necks, pig trotters, or crab (which has a nasty trick of making you eat so much at once that you never crave it again). So, when were craving something, we always think about how great it would be to have our favourite dish. During my COVID quarantine in Shanghai, friends brought me food. Among them was a delicately prepared dish made with duck tongues. I finished it but still wanted more. I don  know how people in the South make their dishes so refined. Truly satisfying foods are small and exquisite, with flavours that only the individual can truly appreciate. This is why they can really satisfy cravings. The highest level of enjoyment is when it becomes a bit addictive, like how people can  stop eating sunflower seeds. At our annual meetings, I have pumpkin seeds, melon seeds, and sunflower seeds in front of me. While listening to the meeting, I start eating, and soon theres a pile of shells, but I keep reaching for more. At that moment, its no longer me but my primal self. Some people eat so many seeds that their teeth get worn out. Remember, cravings and addictions are spiritual pleasures, but they rely on material substances. One of the charming things about Chinese people is that they don  rely on alcohol but find spiritual satisfaction through eating. This satisfaction is repeatable and doesn  increase in quantity. You won  need to eat a hundred duck tongues next time to be satisfied; just eating that specific food will do. Therefore, always ensure you have a source of the foods that can satisfy your cravings and addictions, and keep a good stock of them. This way, whenever I want to be happy, I can achieve it through these means. When I was young, I was obsessed with preserved eggs for a while. In those days of scarcity, you wouldn  believe how delicious a preserved egg with runny yolk could be!"

The most basic reason is to satisfy hunger. But what truly satisfies us are foods that fulfill our cravings. Foods that satisfy cravings often have these characteristics:. 1. Small in quantity but exquisite in quality. 2. Provide a unique sense of satisfaction. 3. Make us want more. Everyone has different food preferences. Some love beer, others prefer chicken feet, and some favor crabs. The important thing is to understand what you truly enjoy and indulge in moderation. While cravings and addiction are spiritual enjoyments, they depend on actual food. The beauty of Chinese food culture lies in its ability to provide spiritual satisfaction through cuisine. This satisfaction can be experienced repeatedly without needing to increase the quantity. Therefore, cherish the sources of food that bring you satisfaction. Leave some space for yourself to fulfill these desires when they arise. This is also a form of self-care. Remember, the small things that make you happy might be your most precious treasures. Like the authors childhood fondness for century eggs, which in times of scarcity, brought satisfaction far beyond the food itself."""

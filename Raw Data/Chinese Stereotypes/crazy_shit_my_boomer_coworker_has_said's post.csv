She makes me exhausted at the most laid back job I’ve ever had. . 1. Anytime she see’s something is made from China she loudly goes “China! tsk tsk” one time she followed it up with “Did you know that 33,000 Chinese people are coming over here and buying up all the land!?” Idk how true any of that is but it definitely has nothing to do with us outsourcing labor oversees which is why everything is made in China. Seriously how does Chinese people in America = American companies making things in China!?. 2. In the middle of working out of nowhere “did you know we never went to the moon” not a question on if I think we have just a matter of fact statement. . 3. These are on two or three different days: “Beautiful sky! No spraying. They didn’t spray that gmo chemicals stuff.” And separately “It’s gonna rain tomorrow, they always spray before it rains.” . Now I know that cloud seeding is a thing but 1. It’s not gmo chemicals and 2. The “spraying” wasn’t even real “chem trails” it was just wispy clouds. If you’re gonna be a Facebook conspiracy freak at least be consistent with it and know what actual clouds look like (if she even believes in clouds). And no shit it rains after there clouds in the sky, that’s how the water cycle works. . 4.  me standing up and putting my phone in my pocket - “You shouldn’t put the phone next to your body you’ll get cancer. Yeah radiation.” . 5. Ofcourse a bunch of other stuff about how she can’t wait to go watch Trump on the news. And most recently how people should be jailed for burning the American flag (something protected by our first amendment rights). She always moves the shirts I put out that actually match our theme park and location and insists on putting out the basic Walmart looking American flag shirts. . P.S. My fiancé follows this subreddit so hi if you find me and recognize this! . "

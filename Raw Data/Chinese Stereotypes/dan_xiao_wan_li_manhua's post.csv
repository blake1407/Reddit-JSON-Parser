The art style caught my attention since it reminds me of some of those other manhuas like 2ha, You Own My All, Mdzs, Tgcf, etc . and as I searched, I found out that the manhua was called Dan Xiao Wan Li or ""Thousand Miles of Heaven "" in English. but Dang! I was so devastated!!  . I actually love reading Historical Manhuas specially when it comes to BL. I was so sad before after knowing Chinas Law about ""censorships"". After all the BLs Ive encountered, Chinas BL stories really hits different than the other BLs from other countries and thats why I love it! All their BL stories would have been a banger if this law never existed but owh well, we can  do anything about it  . I was trying to look for the whole chapter of this manhua I just found because I was so eager to read it. But I was left with disappointment in the end!  . I found out that you can  read it anywhere unless you try and learn how to read Chinese . I was so sad since no one was also willing enough to translate it in English. At that time, I realized that its not just this but there are also tons of unrecognized yet amazing BL manhuas out there that only Chinese people can be able to grasp and read!  . Sorry for making this longer than I originally planned. I just really want to vent my frustrations out here since I can  vent it in real life!  . How about you guys?.  what are your thoughts about these?"

P1Harmony,bingbingxin,t2_rbm0myo1s,t3_1e6ygs1,,07/19/24 04:06,0,152,1.0,26,"""Dead crowd and stalking in Macau. You read it right, Macau was really, really bad. And I bet the members thought so too. (PS : This is not a generalization of Chinese fans since half of the fans in Seoul were Chinese and well behaved!! I don’t know what the hell happened in Macau though.). Put your phone down !. Except for the last row, everyone was constantly filming the members. I was so upset because the members kept asking everyone to jump and dance, and most fans were dancing and screaming in the last two rows, but the people in front of us were still and focused to film the member to post the videos on social media. It was so annoying that the members kept asking fans to be more energetic, even Soul did and I was shocked. Also it was so embarrassing that Keeho made Intak dance sexily for people to scream, I felt so ashamed of our fans here. Not listening. It happened few times that the members tried to keep the fans quiet to play some games with them, or just ask them to move a bit, no one was listening. It’s not even a language barrier problem, since Macanese understand english, Korean and Chinese. When I tell you Theo was pissed…. . Favoritism. It already happened in Seoul, and it will happen again and again since it’s not something that bothers most Chinese fans apparently. When the members go and change, they play some short films of them acting or just looking cool. Keeho on the screen : AHHHH!!. Intak on the screen : AHHHHHH!!!. Jongseob : not a sound, except for me and 5 persons . They don’t particularity dislike him, no, they like every member but they only scream for their bias, and since Jongseob is less biased because Chinese people think he doesn’t look attractive enough for them… Yeah. A lot of them even chatted together whenever he was talking. . Stalking. A lot of fans went for a walk a day before the concert and ""involuntarily"" stumbled across the members visiting Macau. They followed them without a sound for more than ten minutes, right behind them, and all of these posts and videos make me so uncomfortable. In Chinese society, the topic of boundaries is talked about extremely differently, but for cases like that, a lot of people will recognize how wrong it is to follow some celebrities without talking to them and just looking creepy and uncomfortable. I’ll put some pictures. . Now I’m quite worried that the members feel some resentment towards Chinese fans, it was the same when WayV came to Chengdu (a city in China) and were upset on stage because they got mobbed at the airport. Some people really ruin it for everyone. Intak was really, really upset that day. But anyways, the boys were amazing once again, it was really cute how they tried to speak Chinese (Jongseob had an amazing accent it was so impressive lol), but hopefully next time I’ll see them out of China. At least I got back with tons of freebies!. "

Yes!! The stalking makes me super uncomfortable too, we can’t stop these people because they don’t really realize that what they are doing is wrong, if I call them out I’d be a minority. . Theo and Intak looked especially bored, my friend went to the soundcheck and showed me the videos, she didn’t look super hyped and I asked her why did Intak look so down ? He kept on looking down for the whole thing so I don’t know if it’s concert-related, or the stalking, tiredness or private reason. He was so happy in Seoul, it was weird to see him like this . Maybe I’m more negative towards the concert because as I said my side was dead, so hopefully P1Harmony focused on the people who were more energetic, they usually do. Hopefully p1eces will be jumping more in HK, I really want P1Harmony to like us over here"""

P1Harmony,bingbingxin,t2rbm0myo1s,t1ldwv1nb,t1ldwtr2s,07/19/24 07:13,2,3,0,1,"""I don’t know on which side of the pit you were but on my side it was pretty bad, people were not moving at all, when we were asked to sit down for follow me, the people in front of me kept on recording and we had to yell at them to sit. It was so weird on my side, it felt like only my friend, few people behind and I were screaming, I even lost my voice because everyone was dead quiet around us. . I do agree on something, Soul was way happier and talkative than when I saw him in Seoul on both days. I’m glad you had a good experience, overall it wasn’t horrible, for about 1600 attendees I understand we can’t be louder than other venues with more people, but at least jumping on jump is a minimum? I have a video of me filming jump for ten seconds, I’m jumping like crazy with a friend and the people in front of me were not moving an inch. Come on… it’s literally Jump?? . I do agree the fans were nice, I hung out with everyone for the whole day in the hotel and exchanged many many freebies, that’s not an issue at all, I had a really good time with them! I just feel like it could have been much better if people stopped recording nonstop and respected the members when they asked us to quiet down when they were talking, sit down, stand up or jump. It’s not that hard and it makes the experience way better :/ Idk if you’re from the mainland but it was already so expensive for us to get there so yeah, I was disappointed and not the only one. Maybe the crowd was especially dead my side? could be"""
P1Harmony,tifber,t2830zl5zv,t1ldwtr2s,t31e6ygs1,07/19/24 07:01,1,7,0,2,"""that sounds really bad  and im shocked but here’s my experience since it differed a lot from yours :. the crowd wasn’t that dead imo it was pretty loud + most of the fans that were there were from the mainland so the language barrier was still an issue lol (there was a translator but he wasn’t doing a great job im ngl) maybe it was the people around me? the cheering was very organized (at the end of songs, not during them, except for fanchants for title tracks) but not very quiet. it’s a small venue with not a lot of people after all so you can’t expect that much noise comparatively . i agree with how bad the phone/camera issue was — i was really upset to have my view blocked by a selfie stick sometimes. also asian fans in general tend to stick to their bias and the favouritism shows in the cheers, but that’s the reality of stan culture in east asia, to be honest.  it’s still annoying though. . for me, the members looked like they were still having a lot of fun though, i thought soul especially was even more energetic than usual . ive seen p1harmony three times and i honestly had a really good experience with other fans in macau! p1eces were super organized and the freebies and fan projects were honestly impressive. based off of the freebies and fan banners i saw, there was a pretty good distribution of goodies between the members. compared to vancouver and toronto, the fans were much more polite too. . the source of most of my qualms with the macau stop was the way the venue was set up, it was very disorganized and confusing . the stalkers obviously can’t be excused  i saw those posts on xhs and was so weirded out by people following them around on private schedules . all in all i had a great time and thought the members did too but reading this post surprised me and is kind of worrying . edit: i did notice that intak and theo looked somewhat upset/bored during soundcheck so im very disappointed in chinese p1ece if it was because of the crowd :/ at the time i didn’t see anything wrong with p1eces behaviour so i thought maybe they were just tired from so much flying around and touring"""
P1Harmony,bingbingxin,t2rbm0myo1s,t1ldwei24,t1ldwe6f5,07/19/24 04:18,0,2,0,0,"""the thing is that most of them were raised to think it is completely normal to do these things, so to that day, they don’t think it’s wrong of them to follow the boys around since they are celebrities. a change in chinese society (or a law regarding privacy) is needed for them to learn :/"""

I’ve seen a lot of videos of concerts in the west, and though it seems fun, it also scares me too as there are a lot of arguments and people trying to touch the members inappropriately. Nowhere is perfect, but Seoul was surprisingly the best, so I hope they’ll have an encore there :’)"""

I saw them in Chicago last year & yeah, the fans did record (me included, but I was in the nosebleeds and was still singing along, dancing, cheering, etc.) and some people were screaming over the members when they were talking, but it wasn’t nearly as bad as you described :/ Hopefully you’ll be able to see them again w/ a better crowd because I truly believe the crowd behavior can make or break a concert!!"""

P1Harmony,bingbingxin,t2rbm0myo1s,t1le1ysd0,t1le1xrjo,07/20/24 04:04,0,1,0,0,"""I thought about the same thing, I watched an interview of P1H recently in which Keeho said he didn’t like it when fans were staring and not saying hi, he also mentioned this behavior was more common in Asia since Asians tend to be a more introverted. I feel like we can’t help it for now but hopefully there will be changes in the future, especially with Chinese people. Since I live there and look like a Uyghur, the muslim minority of China, a lot of people speak really loudly about me or take my videos/pictures for the older generation, yelling out ""Xinjiang !"" like it’s a guessing game or something. With their kind of education and political climate it’s difficult to respect each other boundaries as they see each other like family, while Europeans for example are much more aware of boundaries since they are very individualistic. So basically, they don’t realize they are doing something wrong. About Jongseob, the good thing is that he left a good impression on a lot of people, I’ve seen a lot of fans talk about how ""he looks better in real life and all the cameras in the world should apologize"" lol. They already know he’s good at rapping and charismatic, but that night he gave them what they liked the most by also interacting a lot with the crowd, wearing cat ears etc. It worked, I bet he has a ton of new fans now. .

I feel like the members, Keeho especially, go out of their way to say how respectful and kind P1eces are whenever they run into them, but. what you described is very different from running into the members. Its so upsetting, thats all I can say. My jaw dropped when I got to the part about it being so quiet for Jongseob. I will never understand varying beauty standards; honestly I dont even understand them in my own country. I know the highly variable cheering is something that happens culturally in some places, but I cant help but be upset by it and really dislike it. I just cant imagine ever not cheering for every single member. Even if I were at a festival and saw a band that isnt my favorite, I would still cheer for them. Maybe I wouldnt scream my lungs out, but I would still want them to feel encouraged. Im surprised to see pics from soundcheck - in Boston they were very strict about not letting us take photo or video of soundcheck at all. Ive done soundcheck for other artists and even though they say its not allowed, security was like yeah its fine, just use a phone not a professional camera. So I thought maybe Piwon was just very strict about it for some reason, since it was my first time seeing them."""

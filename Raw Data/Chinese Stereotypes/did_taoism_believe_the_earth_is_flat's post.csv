I have nothing to add to the answers youve received, but I just wanted to point out that (in my opinion) the reason youre getting downvoted is that many people in this subreddit feel like its inappropriate say that Taoists believe ""anything"" in particular. They will say things like, ""If you ask two Taoists the same question, youll get three different answers."" or maybe instead of actually answering your questions, theyll tell you to not ask questions because ""the true Dao cannot be spoken."". You could even ask this subreddit, ""Do Daoists believe in the importance of cultivating themselves?"" and while some here (like me!) would say, ""Absolutely, yes, its a cornerstone."" youd also get a ton of redditors saying stuff that just boils down to, ""I don  believe anything in particular, I just go with the flow man "" . The majority of people participating in this subreddit wouldn  really TECHNICALLY qualify as ""Daoists"" in a traditional, religious, sense. It would be more accurate to say that they/we are westerners with a personal affinity for Daoist philosophy. Most of the redditors in this subreddit would even say to you directly, ""I am NOT religiously daoist."" So when you ask these people, ""Do Daoists believe . ?"" what they hear is, ""Do you, as a self-described daoist, feel compelled to believe certain things just because daoism says to?"" And the answer is no, because they don  feel like they have to believe anything that Daoism says. . What many people here don  understand is that Daoism is not about ""just going with the flow"" and ""doing what feels natural in the moment."" Do we have a central authority that declares dogma, like the Catholic Church? No absolutely not. But that doesn  mean that daoism isn  a religion with a set of beliefs and practices which it can call its own. . Neat question about the flat earth.

taoism,Wrong-Squirrel-6398,t2o7n9gxv71,t1lao9y13,t1lacfl6p,,0,0,0,0,"""To best answer your question I would need to comprehensively examine a lot of manuscripts and compile a list of what each manuscript said, plus attempt to write a best possible commentary without bias. Here’s the best I can do at the moment. Please, take a look at “The Taoist Classic Vol. 2” (you can order it from Shambhala website) p. 305 inside the text called “Solving the symbolic language. What you see is a circle. Inside that circle is a square. Usually the circle means Wuji (See “Cultivating Stillness” text for more explanation, the version used by the Complete Reality School of Daoism with the commentary by Eva Wong). Wuji is the first symbolic emergence of the Dao and often is used symbolically-synonymously with the Dao, even though it is assumed everyone knows that the Dao cannot be put into words or symbols (and Chinese words are symbols, often with stories behind letters and letter strokes; See DaoDeJing ragarding the Dao not being possible to put into words). The circle is represented by the line inside the character for Dao (it was hard to etch circles in bamboo sticks, that’s probably why). So the Dao can be represented by a circle. That circle (just imagine a hula hoop) can be cut and straightened making it a line (being a tube in the hula hoop visualization). So when I see the line in the character for Dao, I, personally, visualize a circle by bending the line in that character into a circle and connecting the two ends to make it a circle in my mind. To me, the circle also means infinity, something we, the finite humans, cannot fathom, or, at least, we usually dont think we can. This makes the circle a good symbol to represent the Dao. Inside that circle on page 305 is a square. What is that square? That square is us, our internal universe, and not just that. That square means containing our internal universe, which is the Dao, if we have attained it and guarding it (looks like that square was symbolized by a pyramid in Ancient Egypt, the pyramid there being an analogous symbol for the Daoist square). Therefore, the square is a circle. The square means guarding our Dao circle while being a circle to others to harmonize with others. I like this symbolism better than a sharp pointy pyramid lol But they are all great symbols. So, instead of putting another circle inside if that square to represent the attained Dao, it’s just easier to leave it at a square inside a circle and explain what the square means as not to overly complicate the drawn symbol and imagery. The more complex the symbol is, the more useless it is when writing or visualizing it. So we can also, in a different context draw a circle representing our planet, then draw a square around it, with the implication of something similar. That way referring to the Earth as a square would mean something… lol one would need to look at specific manuscripts and consult the lineage carriers to fully tell or elaborate :). I don’t think Ancient Daoists thought the Earth was physically a square because they likely were expert navigators, using the celestial bodies (stars, planets, Sun, moon; like Ancient Mayans) to track their path and know how to return to the origin of where they started. This is evidenced by the North star and the associated constellation appearing all throughout the Daoist symbolism. But who knows? Maybe it is a square :/ Today we can’t say it is a square, as there is an overwhelming evidence it is not a square. By saying “who knows if it is not a square?” I show the typical Daoist open-mindedness to the possibility I may be incorrect. That is the Ancient Daoist philosophical way of eliminating bias in then-state-of-the-art Ancient scientific thought, maintaining flexibility (limber mind as Dudeists would likely say), and always be ready to revise one’s perception of reality should there be new evidence. I, personally, like that philosophical approach and attitude better than isisting what we know is the absolute truth, leading to things like, idk.  being stuck for a while thinking the Sun rotates around the Earth while completely ignoring new evidence lol. I hope this somewhat answers your question :) I am using the Complete Reality School of Daoism materials here while not being authorized in that lineage. So take this with a grain of salt (=I am not the one to speak for that lineage), although I am happy to correct anything, if asked, to conform what I said to that lineage, since its super awesome."""

How do we know the construct in our mind/brain is real? We are physical creatures, and we perceive things in 3D visually from a two-dimensional screen, and so we are tricked into thinking our 2D TV’s are 3D, while, in fact, they are not. What if the earth was flat, but the way the light bent around it, seamlessly, made it appear not flat, while it was flat with multiple parallel universes stacked upon each other?. Truth is, there is much more that we don’t know than we think we know. That’s how it will always be, I think lol. I tend to think the earth is round, or more oblique shaped, as the science tells us so, but what if it is a square, and we just don’t have the tools to see that?. Just like Liehzi said once, along the lines,some people’s customs seems strange, but who are we to judge, especially if those are right for them?. Truth is, there is much we don’t know.

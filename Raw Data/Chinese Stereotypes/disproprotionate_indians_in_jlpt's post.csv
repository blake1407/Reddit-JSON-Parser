Whenever there JLPT exams coming close, theres always a lone Indian amongst a sea of Chinese, with a few archipelagos of Malays in the hallways. While its obvious why therell be that many Chinese people, what can be said to explain the rest of the disproportionate amount of Japanese learners by other races?"

Assuming they are not bananas, Chinese people will have an easier time learning kanji since its basically just traditional Chinese characters. For people who are entirely unfamiliar with Chinese characters, kanji is going to be extremely intimidating. So with JLPT being a reading, writing and listening test, I can understand why only the most enthusiastic people will want to learn and test their Japanese at this level."""

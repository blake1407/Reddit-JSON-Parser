They have a channel called ""Out of Context"" where people quote each others weirdest phrases during (or outside of) sessions, such as:. ""Even if it was a +1 stick i would be happy"". ""Im thinking about killing this undead, can i take his cloths off?"". ""Im gonna put my eggs there"". ""you are going to be melee with the witch in a bathroom"". ""I looked into his eyes and i almost got pregnant"". ""Describe to me how you help the crow give birth"". And my personal favorite: ""Chinese people do not exist"". There is an unwritten rule that state that no one is allowed to reveal the context for any phrase."

So many great moments that come back immediately just from reading, and so many good out-of-context lines. Let me dig out a few:.  ""Theres not enough stealth in the world to steal a Duchess from a Party"".  “If you can be a bear, why would you be a human?”.  “Why do we have bricks on a starship?”.  “I think I want to be closer to the cheese”.  ""If wizards were real, they would wear cargo shorts"".  ""Nobody uses their globes naked!"".  ""So hes super bloodied and super shirtless."""

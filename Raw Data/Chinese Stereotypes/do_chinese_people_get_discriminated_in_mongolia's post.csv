Clearly, the Nazis would not increase the Jewish population, and the United States would not increase the Native American population, just as Japan assimilated the Ainu people. In fact, the ethnic groups you mentioned whose population exists but whose ethnic characteristics have disappeared were not affected by China. On the contrary, Uyghurs still maintain their ethnic identity, language, and culture. However, like the people of Quebec in Canada, learning the official language is essential for integrating into the entire nation and economy. Maybe the example isn’t fitting, but you get what I’m saying. Anyway, if you consider this as genocide, then compare the current Uyghur-speaking population with that of any Native American language. Finally, if you label anyone who makes non-negative comments about China as a CCP shill, you should think about what has shaped your current perception and who made you believe you know the so-called truth."""

I used to work with Uyghur colleagues, and through them, I learned a lot about the current situation of the Uyghur people. But honestly, we don’t believe that it constitutes genocide, considering the terrorist incidents that have occurred in Xinjiang and the issues of terrorist infiltration from neighboring countries. What terrifies me is the opinion of people around me. They have never been to Xinjiang, never interacted with Uyghurs (although the opinions of Uyghurs may not always be accurate), but they blindly believe there is genocide there just because the media says so. To me, this is both ridiculous and disturbing.

Many of them were repeating years (18 year old in 10th grade, isnt this sad?). They were made fun of a lot, isolated. One kid notably was made to play a monkey in his class play (monkey was not needed in a play), they put him in a silly monkey suit.

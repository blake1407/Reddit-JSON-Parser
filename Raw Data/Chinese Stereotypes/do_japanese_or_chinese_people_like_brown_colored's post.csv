I’m 5,9 and brown. I wanna go to Japan or China. I know these Asian places prefer white skin. Will the color of my skin hinder my advances in the entertainment industry? Is there hope for me? . I don’t speak any Asian languages. I speak  Spanish,  enough to pass the AP Spanish exam. "

But unfortunately, when I was in China, everyone I knew seemed to be only interested in white skin color. I’ve only seen a handful of people online express their love for brown skin. However, China and Japan are both large populations, and even if only a small percentage of the population is interested in brown skin, that constitutes a large group of people. I would suggest that you focus on the legal aspects, such as how to legally do related work in these countries."""

Pornography is illegal in China and that includes distribution. So that would be a big waste of time. Though Taiwan might be an option, but they dont have an exactly big pornography industry.   . Japan there might be an opportunity. There might be a niche interest in a darker skinned ladies. . . Im presuming youre from the US. Why move at all to a different country to do that?"""

If you do you will notice them pointing and talking about you. But thats just the different culture and the fact that foreigners are still comparitively rare. If youre really thin like me theyll also tell that straight to your face. (Which I really love, theyre really honest right away without much of the superficial BS)"""

While none of my friends or family do much of it, casinos are common and most cities will have a few small ones. Even more common is sportsbetting where you can bet on football matches or horse races. It is also common to do a lot of it online. But I wouldn’t say most people do it. Mainly men."""

Their style of gambling between family is quite easy going though.  Most people break even or win/lose a bit, but never go broke.  Also, it’s just an excuse to sit around and socialize.  Mahjong isn’t my cup of tea, but I love me some poker"""

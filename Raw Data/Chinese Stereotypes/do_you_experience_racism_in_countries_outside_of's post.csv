Where I live, the default is definitely white. Blonde hair, blue eyes, thin body, very sorority-esque type vibes. As a result, many of the poc here avoid the sun and bleach their hair to fit in, and practically anyone who isn  white gets immediately ""othered"", and not in a good way. I am a black/Indian Jamaican (well technically triracial, but mainly afro- and indo), and Im studying in grad school in an engineering field. And its been really rough because not many people look like me. The vast majority of the people Im around are white people, and they seem to look down a lot on poc. In my electrical engineering and computer science courses (which Im trying to switch to career-wise because I love that stuff) there are a lot of Indians, which makes me feel a little better, even though I share nothing with them culturally, I just like being around other dark skinned people. But since I stupidly didn  major in electrical engineering and did biomedical engineering because my dad wanted me to be doctor so bad, Im mainly around white and Chinese people. The Chinese folks are extremely kind to me, and never have made me feel left out or uncomfortable. The white people on the other hand. are another story. They just look down on all of us. Ive been in situations at the last place I worked at where there was a stark contrast between how the white students have been treated vs the poc (East Asian, South Asian, Hispanic, black. everyone). Its very frustrating. Ive had to deal with people cussing at me, screaming at me, telling me Im dumb to my face, throwing me under the bus so Id get in trouble, picking their stuff up when I pass by or while making eye contact with me (as if Im looking to steal), rudely demanding to know why Im in a lab working (despite the fact that you literally need swipe card access to get into any of the lab spaces in the building), ignoring my input and making me feel left out of the group, not inviting me to outings. Ive even had people in group projects try to give me the ""easy work"" so I don  mess anything up (even though Im a straight A student) and get upset if I try to talk more than 1.5 minutes during a presentation while they talk for over 5 lmao. Im in grad school, and I just got my TA assignment last week and Im already freaking out because the last time I TAd a class, the students would ask mainly the white TA and the white professor for help, but ignored me and the East Asian TA (but he was less anxious that I was, so was able to get some people to interact with him, especially if they were also East Asian). Students were extremely rude towards me or would ignore me when I did try to help. I was wondering whether any of you deal with shitty behavior from others as well?"

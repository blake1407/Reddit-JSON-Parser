Im not sure I did a good job with the title but my brother pointed out how different I act around British people and Chinese people when speaking Chinese. Just thinking about it Im kinda surprised how different I act, its not intentional, it just seems to be automatic. I know you can be mixed race and just be part of one culture but I didnt know where else to post this."

You are part of those cultures and are just reflecting your culture back to those who share in it, in a way that creates familiarity for all. Ive used it at work to make certain clients visiting America feel more at ease asking for my help and I like I can do that. . Theres different levels of it that we do that besides culture, certain circles have certain rules. Like while my moms family is Filipino and my friends family is, theres a certain conduct for my moms family that isnt for other Filipino circles. Its specific to the role you play in that family dynamic that influenced the switch more than just the culture, though the cultural rules also apply."""
mixedrace,Chi-Jam,t24bcqq9m,t1l8wx97g,t31dhbiv3,06/16/24 17:20,0,5,0,0,"""Absolutely. I speak and behave completely differently around my Chinese relatives versus my Caribbean relatives (even though the Chinese ones are also from the Caribbean), and amongst my cousins who behave more ""white"", I behave ""whiter"" around them too. Totally subconscious, and I don  know how to not do it. Re. siblings, a friend of mine told me it is common for first siblings to carry more of the culture of the parents, and for the younger ones to identify more with the dominant culture (e.g. ""white""). That seems to be the case with me and my younger brother."""

I can see how this could also be a form of unconscious compensation for amphibious identity — I am not sure, this even may be an influence with me at times, especially if I am or were ""othered"" within one of my groups. . I think behaviour can be nuanced and relative to circumstance, & that you will be able/learn to recognise for yourself where yours may stem from. I really do hope that your brother hasn  left you feeling ill-at-ease or overly self-conscious though — I am unsure if that is partly what may have motivated you to ask here."""

mixedrace,galtiki,t24eatt84y,t1l8vu3h8,t31dhbiv3,06/16/24 13:16,1,3,0,1,"""Yep. Unsure if precisely what you mean but for me it is quite natural and unconscious even. I can recognise my propensity to be more at ease or feel more of my Chinese half when knowing there is familiarity, that I will not be questioned or need to explain particular mannerisms, customs or habits. . I have also learned from Asian friends and reading that there would seem to be palpable cultural influence in my thought processes & outlooks. Makes sense, though this can be surprising to others at times and I myself had not realised when younger. Given that it is your brother who is commenting, I assume the implication is that he does not feel he displays such tendencies. I dont know that my siblings do either — though it is perhaps worth noting that they do not look as outwardly identifiable as Chinese and have not spent as much time as I around extended family, so perhaps that is of some influence."""

mixedrace,ladylemondrop209,t2upbzwpg9,t1l8xwgir,t31dhbiv3,06/16/24 21:33,0,3,0,0,"""Youre describing code switching.  But for me.  I wouldnt necessarily say its different personalities/behaviour. I believe that how the person I am expressed/perceived as in different languages (in part due to fluency/comfort and vocab library and choice) is and will be different  and in turn, that might result in how people react/interact with me, and thus also any mannerisms I may then have in response to that. For example,.  the way I speak chinese is a lot softer (and polite - as I know few harsh adjectives and no profanity/slang) than english. So I may seem like Im more shy, quiet, passive, etc. person, whereas a person who only talks to me in english would more likely think the opposite. I still feel the way I do and (think) I am communicating what I am wanting to (at my language ability), but Im sure that if I were to say the same thing in english (language most comfortable for me), the small nuances in word choice would/may/can make a big difference.

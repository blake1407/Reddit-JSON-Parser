""Land of Creation""). Its almost the most complete (with a national flag, a capital(his village), a major culture(hmongs), a national identity (based on Yangs elitist theory of classifying the Civilized and the Babarians), serious, and longevous (almost existed for 10 years) micronation in China. The micronation was found by Yang Fan, a Hmong man who once served in the military police force and later spent years in philosophy and trolling in online communities. Hes almost the Chinese counterpart of Chris Weston Chandler. He invented the civilized-barbaric theory that classified most Chinese people as barbarians and blatantly praised Hmong traditions. Chuangguo had a diverse economy of agriculture,  husbandry (pigs and chicken, both suffered from extremely high mortality rates due to his negligence), and industry (Yang himself designing and making weird machines that resemble Ork technologies in Warhammer 40k). Most notably, he sold fruit salad and onigiris in a stall in front of an elite high school, later it was discovered that he used the same vessels that he used for fapping. He even had the balls to commemorate the Tiananmen Incident in China. Once he openly disputed with Youtuber Ceylan Le Compte, causing the laters accounts in China to be banned. Later, because of unemployment he returned to his village and worked as a peasant. He named his family asset as (Lit. Hmong village) and took hundreds of videos depicting his rural life. Later he returned to Manchuria, hoping that Manchurians could be more civilized than the Chinese. Finally, he became a desperate incel after being blocked by his female colleagues and declared Manchurians as barbarians. "

When it comes to the whole Russia-North Korea summit meeting that happened this year, someone made this claim:. Escalation of horizontal conflict (2-front expansion). When there is a conflict between countries, there is horizontal conflict escalation, which expands the scope of the conflict horizontally, and vertical conflict escalation, which increases the intensity of the conflict. Vertical conflict escalation is a form of increasing the intensity by fighting with bare hands, then fighting with clubs, shooting guns, firing cannons, launching missiles, and launching nuclear weapons, and horizontal conflict escalation is a form of fighting in East Asia in which conflicts that were only fought in Europe are also fought. A typical example of this escalation of horizontal conflict was in 1950, at the beginning of the Cold War, when the Soviet Union, in order to check the United States and China, allowed North Koreas Kim Il-sung to invade the South, putting the United States and China in a quagmire. In other words, it is a strategy to keep Western powers from getting caught up in war not only in Ukraine, but also in the Middle East and the Korean Peninsula in East Asia, and to prevent them from getting out of the quagmire of war. A few experts are warning of the seriousness of the current situation, which is similar to the theory that the Soviet Union induced American intervention , that Putin could start a war in Korea. Stalins Ghost and Putins Strategy.  The Cold-Blooded International Situation and the Shaking Security Landscape of the Korean Peninsula: . Putins Complex Calculations: . . This is an English translation of the original Korean source that can be found here:. . This is basically claiming that, when Korean War broke out in 1950, Stalins Soviet Union did not participate in the UN Security Council and exercised its veto, so the UN forces intervened and the subsequent clash between the UN forces and the Chinese army was a strategy intended by Stalin. Heres the English translation version of that claim:. . . and heres the original Korean version:. . Here are some of the excerpts:. In the early days when this information was known, some viewed these as bluffs of Stalins spiritual victory. At the time, Stalin was a figure who was revered as a leader representing communism throughout the communist world. In a situation where the Korean War broke out and the United States stepped in to stop it, Stalins own authority was undermined if he admitted that he made an unexpected misjudgment of the United States intervention. This is because it greatly damages the.5 However, this logic cannot explain the Soviet Unions deliberate absence from the UN Security Council and its failure to exercise its veto, and there is no evidence other than speculation. And as time passes and more and more data is discovered and cross-checked, the hypothesis that it was Stalins grand strategy is gaining strength. . Original Korean version:. . Stalin s opposition to the ceasefire. Stalin calculated that it would be fine if the Korean peninsula was unified under communist rule, and that if unification under communist rule failed due to U.S. intervention, the Chinese military would intervene in a dead-end manner, tying the U.S. military to the Korean Peninsula while consuming China, a potential competitor, so it would have been fine no matter what. It may be possible. In fact, during Stalins lifetime, the ceasefire negotiations were not properly carried out due to constant back and forth, and after Stalins death, the ceasefire negotiations proceeded very quickly and the war ended. Believing that war between the United States and the Soviet Union was imminent on the continent and that tying up American military capabilities on the Korean Peninsula would give the Soviet Union an advantage in an impending war in continental Europe, Stalin believed that the Chinese and North Korean leaders Despite expressing concern about the operation continuing the Korean War, he wanted to continue the Korean War. By May 1953, all of the communist leaders in the Soviet Union felt that the ongoing war in Korea had to be stopped.  Thus, Stalins death opened up an opportunity for senior Soviet leaders to implement a series of political reforms. The sweeping turn of Soviet foreign policy and the resulting major international systemic change was made possible by senior Soviet policy makers after Stalins death. In the spring and early summer of 1953, Soviet leaders in particular were now able to put an end to Stalins ""wrong policy"" on the Korean peninsula, while at the same time seeking a speedy end to the situation. In the spring and early summer of 1953, Soviet policy changed radically compared to the policy stance maintained just before under Stalin. Thus, an armistice could be signed on 26 July. Stalins Death and the Implications for Ending the Korean War: . Stalins global strategic goal through the Korean War, as stated in a telegram sent to Czech President K. Gottwald on August 27, 1950, was to draw the United States and China into the Korean War and continue the war for a long period of time to protect the United States. The goal was to secure time for the Soviet Union to strengthen socialism in Europe by tying its hands and feet to the Korean Peninsula and consuming Americas resources. Therefore, ending the Korean War through negotiations between the United States and China did not meet Stalins strategic goals in any case. Accordingly, on December 31, 1950, Mao Zedong told Soviet scholar P. Yudin, “We are not opposed to continuing this war, because if the U.S. forces were to remain on the Korean Peninsula for another day, it would further weaken them. “This is because it can promote discord within American imperialism and strengthen social public opinion against them.” This shows that Mao Zedong had a good understanding of Stalins intentions. Since Stalins will to oppose a negotiated resolution of the Korean War was clear, it was difficult for Mao Zedong to agree to the January 13 UN ceasefire plan that satisfied his demands. A study on the strategic conflict between Mao Zedong and Stalin in the early days of the Chinese Peoples Volunteer Armys participation in the war: . . Original Korean version:. . This is the English-translation version of the whole page:. . . and this is the original Korean version of the whole page:. . Please note that these English versions might be rough translations, so some of the sentences might not be in good shape. But basically, that user seems to be claiming that either:. 1. Putin will convince North Korea to invade South Korea after supplying North Korea with Russian weapons and resources so that South Korea and the United States will be weaken from war and won  be able to focus on Ukraine after that - or South Korea will be wiped from existence entirely. 2. Putin will invade South Korea after requesting North Korea to lend its border similar to how he asked Belarus to do so before invading Ukraine. 3. Putin and North Korea will invade South Korea together and wipe it out from existence. And with Trump, who is apparently going to pull out U.S. military from South Korea and completely scrap U.S.-South Korea alliance almost immediately after he becomes the president, thus leaving South Korea completely on its own, being 100% guaranteed to become the president again, do you expect that South Korea will completely cease to exist by next year at the latest due to Russia and North Korea invading and take over the said country in less than a week, if not a day? Why or why not?"

WeChat is an extremely closed platform, and even if you sign up for an account after an unfamiliar invitation, you may run into more trouble the rest of the way since youre not Chinese. And only Chinese users can help you, but Chinese people cant browse reddit because of the governments internet blocking."

Are you saying that because someone who is Chinese hasn’t been to USA that they shouldn’t have access to Facebook ?   Play games how ?   WeChat is a powerful platform of social networking and should be free for everyone to access it regardless of whether or not they want to play games or not."""

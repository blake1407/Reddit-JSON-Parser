A secure file sharing approach and pioneer model implementation of Cryptographic Torrents by the Encryption Suite Spot-On - Decentral Crypto-Magnet-Links successing the traditional central Torrent-Trackers? A first insight. . Cryptographic torrents are a form of peer-to-peer file sharing that use cryptographic techniques to enhance security, privacy, and integrity of the data being shared. Unlike traditional torrents, which may expose users to privacy risks and content tampering, cryptographic torrents implement advanced encryption methods to protect the data and the identities of users involved in the file sharing process. Features of Cryptographic Torrents.  Encryption: Data transferred via cryptographic torrents is encrypted, ensuring that only authorized users can access the content. This prevents unauthorized access and eavesdropping.   Anonymity: Some implementations of cryptographic torrents may incorporate anonymization techniques to hide the identities of users, protecting their privacy.   Integrity: Hashing algorithms are used to ensure that the data has not been altered. Each piece of the torrent file is hashed, and these hashes are verified upon download to ensure data integrity. Spot-On Encryption Suite & Torrent-like File-Sharing - but encrypted. The Spot-On Encryption Suite is a software application that includes various cryptographic tools and technologies aimed at enhancing security and privacy in digital communications and also encrypted torrent-like file-sharing. Spot-On has initiated and contributed to the development and implementation of cryptographic torrents through the following means:.  Advanced Encryption Algorithms: Spot-On integrates state-of-the-art encryption algorithms that can be used to secure the data in torrents. This includes both symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques to protect data during transfer. .  Key Management: Spot-On provides robust key management features, including the generation, distribution, and storage of cryptographic keys. This ensures that only authorized users with the correct keys can decrypt and access the torrent data.   Secure Messaging & file-sharing Protocols: Spot-On supports a secure messaging protocol, which is called the Echo protocol, that is also integrated within the torrent filesharing tab of this client to provide encrypted communications and file-transfer between friends. This prevents eavesdropping and human-in-the-middle attacks.  File-Sharing with Chat-Friends: Files can be sent over the 1:1 Chat window, which has alread established a secure channel. Multi-Encryption secures the chat, and also the transfer of a file.   StarBeam - File-Sharing with in the Sharing-Tab: Next to sending files over chat, there is also a File-Sharing tab in the client. This Tab is called StarBeam. The StarBeam has all what is needed, Sub-Tab for recieve files, send files, and also to prepare files. To prepare or download a file a Magnet-Link is used and created and know from Torrenting. This Magnet link though is the invention of Spot-On to provide Cryptographic Torrents. The link contains further cryptographic values.  Cryptographic-Magnet Links: As with torrents, Spot-On Encryption Suite uses also Magnet-Links we all know from regular insecure torrents. But the invetion is, to equip these new standard of Magent-Links with cryptographic values, which in working together with the encrypting Echo protocol and secures the downloads and the files. A Magnet Links looks like this:. `magnet:?ct=aes256&ek=l7WeFqOxKPHh2x48pEFHsbly9DUJn2fC&ht=blake2b512&mk=Tgw75fRaB6NYXFfHFbyOuB4k7TTwyQLxor4k4Gh8IVLcH4gG/AD+RdkkRCtTmUPuHk6YbB5V7xwb0/EiKIZjMg==&xt=urn:starbeam`.  Magnet-Link as decentral Torrent-Tracker: This Creation of a Magnet-Link can be regareded in analogy of the Insecure-Trorrents as a Torrent-Tracker, because of the cryptographci values it is a secure and Magnet link respective Torrent-Tracker for Cryptographic Torrents. Because of the used protocol, there is no central IP reseved for the tracker. Instread the encryption of each packet in the network is in each node proved with the vales form the Magnet-Link. This means, there needs no central instance to unite friends interested in a certain file or download, the network brings up the packets and the cryptographic values from the Magent-Link for a Cryptographic Torrent track and bring the parts together in a decentral way. So simple, so easy: In Cryptographic Torrents the Magnet-Link is the tracker - no extra software & no tracker-server needed.  Decentralization and Peer Discovery: Spot-Onâ€™s technologies can enhance the decentralization aspects of torrents by providing secure methods for friend authentication and connection establishment, reducing the reliance on central trackers and enhancing privacy.  Swarming of sources though encrypted: Spot-Ons Cryptographic Torrent-like file sharing with Cryptographic Magnet-Torrent-Links provide swarming of sources tought the packets are encrypted. In a network of 3 or 5 friends, two or more sources can upload at the same time to a downloader and increase the richness to receive encrypted packets. Summary: The Implementation of Cryptographic Torrents in combination with the Echo protocol. By incorporating these cryptographic features and tools, the Spot-On Encryption Suite has helped to address several of the vulnerabilities and privacy concerns associated with traditional torrenting. It enables the creation of a more secure and private file sharing environment, fostering trust among users and protecting the integrity of shared data. Cryptographic Torrent-Magnet-Links as set in the new standard of torrenting StarBeams-File-Sharing as explained above - in combination with the specific details of an Echo-Network - provide a solid implementation worth to be explored within the torrent scene. . In summary, cryptographic torrents leverage advanced encryption and authentication methods to enhance security and privacy in friend-to-friend file sharing (with hopping over friends, respective in the proxyfying Echo network). The Spot-On Encryption Suite has developed a significant implementation in this domain by providing the necessary cryptographic ideas for file-sharing and protocol to implement these features and being a pioneer in encrypted torrented file-sharing. Outlook: The further development of Cryptographic Torrents. Spot-On started the development of cryptographic torrents. The torrent market is overwhelmed by the industry like portal-, tracker-, client- and content-provison. Means, to see this new technology implemented in a broad sense, it needs from all stakeholders inputs and also probably a much simpler client - which could be just the StarBeam-Tab of the pioneering client - for downloading these Echo-Torrents from and to be an etablished network of connections. ""We will study"" - as the Chinese people say: Exploring, learning, testing, coding, building up structures and networks might be the actions of a new generation, if not the habits of the establishment by torrent freaks is enriched with new ideas to secure traditional torrents, as the market, the technic and in the first place users interests require secure torrents more than ever. As analysts have stated for VPN-Torrents and Closed-Shop-Trackers the need to enrich the procedures with cryptographic security is given as a valid request. Spot-Ons provided (and workable) Model of Cryptographic Torrents might play a role in further analysis, concepts and creation of those who are interested and cappable. . The risk of downloading insecure torrents and the interest in secure transfers, even more in file sharing: the interest in the secure standard to swarm and download files with procedures known from traditional torrents - has been provided with the model of Cryptographic Torrents within the Spot-On Encryption Suite as a real pioneer in this regard.

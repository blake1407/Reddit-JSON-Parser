ADVChina,Significancefl1331,t2_4fhi1lae,t3_1dga4r4,,06/15/24 00:46,0,3,1.0,4,"""Dragon Man. The Dragon man story is making the rounds again. If you don’t know the story of the Dragon Man I’ll give a short recap. In 1933 a scull was found during construction in China. WWII happened, then Mao so research on the skull was delayed until the twenty teens. A group of scientists from one of the Chinese Universities along with some international scientists. The University released a report saying that it was a new species of man. The forgiven scientists disagree. The CCP tell the Chinese people they are special and different. They saw this as an opportunity to prove this. A new article or an older one goes around Twitter and Reddit every few months. Most of the time these articles contain facts that are incorrect. The last one claimed the skull was found in 2000’s. I didn’t post the last article because I didn’t want it getting linked. It was on earth.com. Which is a site that is pay for articles. The sad thing is that it’s actually a cool find that could be De Denisovans. Wikipedia clouds the issue but does contain some the correct information of course it depends on when you look. Please be aware of the Dragon Man story and not repost and if you have time set the record straight "

I agree there should be a DNA genome of this if any can be extracted. Since as of now DNA test is be allowed or released and peer reviewed we may have to wait for a change in government to actually see. There have been other finds as well from other areas but no meaningful information has come out. Just like any else out of official Chinese sources I’m skeptical. After the false and fake Dino fossil finds in the past decade is sad and without any outside collaboration any scientific info can’t be believed. I really sucks because I love to read about new anthropological finds."""

As you indicate, this is ridiculous and scientifically illiterate. Comparison of the genomes of Chinese Han people with those of other ethnic groups shows that there are no significant differences. Regarding the question of which species the dragon man belongs to, its probably best to wait until some DNA has been extracted from the skull and sequenced. Speculation at present isnt very helpful."""

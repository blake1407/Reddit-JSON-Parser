I am of Chinese descent but only proficient in English. I take pride in having learned the worlds lingua franca, which meets all my needs without the need to learn another language. However, I dislike it when people assume I can speak, read, or write in Chinese just because I am Chinese. There are many people in the U.S. who cant speak English despite living here for years. Its especially frustrating when other Chinese people dont understand that I am not proficient in Chinese. I dont want to sound like a self-hating Asian, but Chinese/Asian people who constantly harp on my lack of Chinese fluency are certainly reinforcing my American identity. What are your thoughts? Should racial identity be tied to language?"

Then are you suggesting that a stupid HS course is enough?. No.  lets just teach our children our native languages and stop trying to be something we arent. You sound quite young. Its not too late to learn your Chinese. Dont convince yourself it is. Then you can teach it to your children. Many people manage to teach their children both languages. Some parents just get lazy.  and unfortunately sometimes ashamed and dont teach the native. But it doesnt have to be this way."""
CasualConversation,ChronowalkerZ,t2n2f0igbik,t1ld1xt8u,t1ld1x18f,07/13/24 18:22,8,1,0,1,"""I am suggesting that parents enroll their children in a language school. For example, there are Chinese schools scattered across the U.S., particularly in areas with significant Chinese communities. . I remember I had to take a second language during high school too, with options including French, Japanese, and Spanish. Why is it that many schools in East Asia have English as part of their curriculum despite being less funded than many U.S. schools?"""
CasualConversation,KnownExpert3132,t210o1gwcss1,t1ld1x18f,t1ld1wgj0,,7,1,0,1,"""So youre suggesting that our schools teach our children our languages? Or are you suggesting they teach all students a second language.  and if so how is that chosen for those who have no native language that isnt English?. You also in this conversation realize that our schools are already taxed and suffering, not to even mention the teacher shortage."""
CasualConversation,ChronowalkerZ,t2n2f0igbik,t1ld1wgj0,t1ld1vmx0,07/13/24 18:17,6,1,0,1,"""This phenomenon is evident in many Asian and Hispanic communities. The challenge lies in the younger generations inability to pass on their heritage language to their children, often due to their own limited proficiency. Despite having some basic knowledge of the language, it’s typically not enough for effective teaching. I advocate for language learning through structured classroom settings. Professional instructors can provide the guidance and resources necessary to facilitate the learning process."""
CasualConversation,KnownExpert3132,t210o1gwcss1,t1ld1vmx0,t1ld1v0bs,07/13/24 18:13,5,1,0,1,"""In the states? The child learns to read and write in school.  so it will be English but most people read to their children and some of the native language can be taught that way to read. Also it can be learned later on. Whats more important is the speaking.  so the child doesnt become alienated from his or her people."""
CasualConversation,ChronowalkerZ,t2n2f0igbik,t1ld1v0bs,t1ld1uhle,07/13/24 18:08,4,2,0,1,"""What about reading and writing?"""
CasualConversation,KnownExpert3132,t210o1gwcss1,t1ld1uhle,t1ld1tiyi,07/13/24 18:04,3,2,0,1,"""You can have one parent teach the native language and the other parent teach the English. Nobody has to take time out of their day to talk to their children. Talking is how a child learns a language."""
CasualConversation,ChronowalkerZ,t2n2f0igbik,t1ld1tiyi,t1ld1t4sz,07/13/24 17:54,2,1,0,1,"""I think it goes beyond the parents. If you look at East Asian countries, many children there can speak, read, and write in English. This is mainly because English is part of their curriculum and they start learning it at a young age. Expecting parents to teach their children another language is unrealistic when they are focused on working and providing for their families."""
CasualConversation,KnownExpert3132,t210o1gwcss1,t1ld1t4sz,t31e2ln3y,07/13/24 17:51,1,3,0,1,"""I hate how we always seem to have to choose to teach our children only one language in these scenarios most often. Dammit teach your children both please. You leave them alienated if you choose just one.  no matter which one you choose."""

It’s great that you were taught English, yes, but why not also Chinese?  .  Being Bilingual is really helpful and it’s like you were purposely robbed of that . .  If my parents were fluent in another language but only spoke English around me growing up and never taught me any of that other language I would really resent it."""

Good question, that I cant really answer as a European mongrel who speaks three languages fluently and has a double citizenship. Just do whatever you want. It really doesnt matter in the end. But speaking more than one language is always a good thing, that will broaden your horizon and way of thinking about things."""

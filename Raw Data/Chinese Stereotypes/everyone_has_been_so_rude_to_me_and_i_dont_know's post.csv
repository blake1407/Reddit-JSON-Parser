I’m currently traveling in China with my father for the first time. This is my first time in China and I honestly just feel so alone and sad. I speak mandarin almost fluently with my dad (my mother is white) but I cannot read or write. Every since arriving, so many people have been so blatantly rude to me it’s honestly overwhelming as I don’t understand why. Today I asked the front desk lady at the hotel for help with connecting to the wifi. The password we were given kept giving us an error message. She told me that even two year olds can figure it out and wouldn’t help me. I tried to explain about the password error and showed her the message on my phone. She laughed loudly at me and kept pointing to a sign by her desk written in Chinese that I couldn’t read. I had no way to translate it as I had no wifi. She kept underlying the sign with her finger and repeatedly told me that I’m not as smart as her two year old granddaughter. (I Google translated the sign later and it just said “information desk”). Last night when my dad and I were eating at a small local noodle shop and the lady was so rude, throwing the food down on the table and spraying hot oil all over my face. I asked politely in mandarin if she could get us more napkins and she just scoffed and walked away. . This kind of thing has been happening to me since arriving 4 days ago. No matter where I go, people either ignore me or haul insults. My dad is not much help as he is a very timid person and this is his first time in China in almost 10 years. I don’t understand why it seems like other foreigners have nothing but praise for Chinese people and the culture yet I’ve yet to have one nice experience. . Is there something that I’m doing wrong? I’ve tried to be as nice and polite as possible and my mandarin is alright. I’ve never had problems communicating with my grandparents on my dad’s side, my dad’s friends or any of his extended family. I understand that I cannot take cultural norms from the west and expect it to be the same here, but surely I must be missing something? I’m genuinely at a loss and would appreciate any advice. . Please be kind to me though as this is genuinely my first time in China and all I want is to connect better with my dad and my Chinese heritage. "

Westernisms like honourific titles sir, madam, miss, and platitudes said BEFORE getting to the point don’t happen in mainland China so much. When customers in the West get mad at reception they might cause a little puff of but won’t always dare to make a loud dramatic scene, but for Chinese especially mainlanders this is infamous behaviour. They would flash their Rolex or literally throw bundles of cash at reception to jump the queue. I had a Shanghainese boss once who was frustrated at the airport for being treated as an economy class customer (executive with heaps of flyer points) so instead of talking to the low-ranking staff stormed down a maze of corridors to the head office like she owned the place and demanded to be put in first class asap. And it worked!  Well kinda. They put us in business class since it was truly full, and us junior staff were still stuck in coach beside the toilet haha. That in a nutshell is how China works. Cronyism. The super rich and powerful browbeat others. There’s a hypocritical double-standard in Chinese society that everyone knows exists. It’s unlike a democratic parliamentarian society where people are naively egalitarian and actually believe their votes or negative ‘reviews’ do something. It’s also not like Chinese don’t know any better but this type of corruption is a very old problem. The only way I guess is to call it out when it happens, appeal to their sense of justice, fairness, shame, or you’ll be trampled on. Appearing rich (ostentatiously evenly tastelessly rich) will also work in your favour in such scenarios. Visual discrimination is huge in China/Asia. Most people get classed as rich “having money” or poor “not having money”. Stupid things like designer products and high fashion signals that to people to take you seriously. It’s unlike how an American billionaire wears casual clothes to work or Danish royalty like riding bicycles into town. Such reverse behaviour isn’t common in China. The average lower-middle class American appearance/presentation would be considered “poor” to many middle class Chinese. Wearing flip flops is common in Australian beach culture, even fashionable, but it’s not wise to do this in China as customer service WON’T serve me if I look this way."""

Maybe your comment was meant for the main thread to the OP? I simply highlighted some of my observations, at the superficial level. It doesn’t reflect ‘treatment’ or ‘mistreatment’ altogether since the story would undoubtedly change if you relocate and live there and become a local. So this is more about what happens when locals see you as an obvious tourist or transient guest many will exploit that. Appearance and presentation (regardless of race/ethnicity) is huge in cultures that judge face value with extreme prejudice. I’m not sure that generalising “Asian” and “European” is helpful since the post/sub is “China” specific and China is unquestionably the dominant culture in Asia. Well anyway, part of the reason for racism against “Asians” in the West is firstly due to our own “Chinese” problems and the unfortunate reputation of misdeeds and worst traits of ours HEAVILY amplified by Western sinophobic propaganda that distort the truth as if ALL “Chinese” (and Asians) behave a certain way all the time. It’s Western bigotry. There’s too much to be said on that front. Without Chinese silk there would be no silk textiles in the famous Lake Como area, high fashion in Milan, or wealth pouring into Venice. Without Chinese paper and printing press Europe would still be an illiterate society in the dark ages. Without Chinese gunpowder there would be no warmongering European Western imperialists. Without Chinese manufacturing the bulk of the world’s stuff would not be made. But who ever gives us credit for this in Europe or the West? Despite that Chinese and Asian tourists are open-minded enough to love visiting their countries. The ‘mistreatment’ is not nearly as balanced as you are supposing."""

After the CCP destroyed culture heritage stuff they realised that tourism and other Chinese things were great cash cows so certain cities actively target foreigners/Whites and discriminate against other Chinese. Also unlike cultural reforms under British rule in Hong Kong (like similar cultural rebranding in Japan - smiling and politeness culture) Chinese are at heart very blunt and extremely honest. “You are fat” is a health assessment, not necessarily an insult. Likewise “even a child can do this” is an objective observation, not necessarily a criticism. This is both a cultural merit and demerit as we have little ‘polite’ culture or ‘etiquette’ that was practiced in imperial times. Commoners especially don’t give a rats since so many governments screwed poor people over so that deeply engrained skepticism and cynicism makes people snappier, nastier, and rude be it at home or in customer service. Not all, not most, but many. In contrast to the West there is an overall optimism, a SENSE that we are equal (not true), that we are free (not true), that we can achieve anything (not true), but that false hope via media and propaganda on school the national anthem etc gives just enough a sense of hope that most people strive to be better, upwardly mobile, aspirational, etc. But even if people act nice it doesn’t meant that their heart is nice or they will do anything significant yo help you in life. For Chinese it is the opposite. Peoples presentation can be disgusting, vile, nastiest person on social media, but when push comes to shove, at breaking point, they will honour their parents, die for their friends, as opposed to backstab, rob, or shoot them in the back. Aside from politically brainwashed people Chinese have an inherent goodness inside. There’s lots of examples in Chinese history in contrast to Western history. But it’s also from seeing ourselves as one “family” not just a nation. We have blood and ancestral ties. What your experiencing could also be that some Chinese look down on Westernised Chinese or non-native upper class Chinese. It could be as simple as your shoes aren’t Gucci, or your cheeks don’t look plump like a fattened CCP member. There are hundreds of superficial ways to discriminate Chinese on Chinese. There’s no point dwelling on it. Each village also has different characteristics, but often the same generous and kind hospitality. But about Chinese people in general my experience in Taiwan was wildly better to my experience in Shanghai and Hong Kong, at the initial surface level. People stopped to offer help everywhere I went. They did things for free and strangers gone me their time. It was a little sycophantic in expensive hotels but they were sincere, unlike artificial treatment in SH and HK, where it’s more obviously pretentious and even small favours have the feeling of ‘if I scratch your back’."""

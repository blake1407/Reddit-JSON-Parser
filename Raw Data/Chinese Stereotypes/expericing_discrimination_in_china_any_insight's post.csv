Ive been experiencing very overt hostility in Chengdu/Chongqing which I have never run into in the past (when visiting Shanghai/Beijing), and Im wondering if its because I look Korean. I feel very unwelcome here & wish I did not come back. Ive been getting a lot of hostile stares, rudeness, curtness, women moving away from me on the subway, taxi driver yelling, & people being hostile at the club. I thought it was very weird & different from when I visited in the past. I asked 5-6 people & they thought I was Korean. I thought maybeeee it was in my head, but then I tried dressing to fit in (baggy t shirt that covered up my tattoos), took off my piercings, tried to not style my hair, and people treated me much much better. Everyone was much more polite & friendly that day - I was given extra servings of food, gifted some samples while shopping, people would actually talk to me when I asked them & try to explain things to me if I asked. People sometimes spoke first to me in Chinese so I think they assumed I was Chinese too. This was just in a single day & I felt like things were back to normal. I tried wearing my normal clothes again which is more Korean style to test things out, and immediately felt like I had a target on my back. Right away first thing of the day, a taxi driver started yelling at me after the ride (he said this is roughly where it is, I dont know where the store is you can find the exact location yourself now get out etc). I bought a baggy t shirt and put it on and then I felt like people acted normal to me again =(. Appearance wise, I do have piercings & tattoos and Im fairly tan right now. I used to look different and despite usual occasional rudeness I never felt any hostility. People who have been post covid, can you share some insight?  Is it so skin color, tattoos/piercings, fashion style, dislike for Korean men, or dislike for all foreign men? Is it like this everywhere in China?. Edit - I dont look like a thug  "

I have lots of Korean friends and it’s true.  these are the spicy people of China. I get asked a few times a year from old people on the street if I’m Japanese and when I laugh and say… no I’m American they cuss out Japanese and laugh. Their history always tells them to NEVER forgive and always remind everyone how they were treated.  so, that’s what you’re gonna experience especially in these two provinces in my experience. . When the fishing island problems were really active in China, our school told the Japanese students to never talk in Japanese and if they are approached to always say they are Korean and the Koreans to not talk in Korean on the street because the locals would also threaten them for being Japanese because most people don’t know the difference in the languages. That being said, this is my experience and how I’ve seen it happen.  the locals destroyed all the Japanese cars and bashed out restaurants windows for a few weeks.

If you spoke Chinese fluently with a native accent, theyd probably peg you as a regular Chinese dude. Truth is, unless there is an obvious identifier that marks you as foreign, East Asian people all think you belong to their country (except Koreans, theyre pretty snooty that they even attribute the ugly Koreans as being Chinese). When I was in Japan, I was Japanese (was able to go to Japanese-only establishments as long as I didn  open my mouth and speak). When I was in Korea, I was Korean. When I was in China I was Chinese. Its probably some other thing giving you away as a foreigner. I know that in Asia in general, especially more conservative countries like China, tattoos are still unironically for bad people (Japan/Korea are more liberalized, places like China/Malaysia/Singapore are still a bit prudish). My cousin whos pretty rich still needs to use a ""gangster"" spa because of a small tattoo he has on his chest from when he was a teen. Try covering up your tattoos and maybe dress more respectfully and see if it continues.   . EDIT: Actually yeah come to think about it, it probably is your piercings/tattoos. If you can pull it off while looking respectful I would go for it. If you look anything like this person, don  expect people to be very accepting.

Although Chongqing kinda has a reputation for being more accepting towards lgbtq community it shouldn’t be mistaken with Shanghai/Beijing where people are very used to foreigners. Though I don’t think people dress that unanimously if you are in more central parts of cities people do tend not to dress according to a mainstream culture. Yeah I don’t think Covid necessarily has much to do with this. Probably the region matters more. As for people looking and yelling at you, do you mean they just stare and talk in overly loud voices? Although you say you don’t have those issues when you try to pass as Chinese, I find it a bit unlikely that something you wear is so distinctively Korean that people would be hostile towards you. I mean even if you wore traditional Korean clothes you’d still be probably confused with wearing Hanfu. I think it’s more likely that the way you dress (again tattoos and piercings are associated with , basically criminals/degenerates), people might have found your fashion style a bit too unfamiliar, but I can’t say for certain ofc. The buying a guy a drink case kinda confused me. Did you know the guy well? I wouldn’t accept your drink if I didn’t know you either. If you did know the guy well, how did he refuse? Refusal itself doesn’t equal unfriendly behavior. The nightclub thing is also kinda confusing, did you have trouble communicating with them and was there a language barrier? Did they say those exact words and said “oh we thought you were Korean”. I don’t know how clubs work, and although it does sound very rude to remove you from your table, I still don’t immediately see it’s related to xenophobia - unless if you have more info ofc but I understand you’d feel too tired to go over everything again.

I also tried to buy a table at a nightclub one night and after sitting down and ordering they gave it to someone to else, and asked me to move elsewhere.

As a Shanghai native I really can’t imagine this happening in Shanghai but other places I’m less certain. I don’t think xenophobia explains it completely since ppl do sound nice when you make it clear you are a foreigner in “normal dress”. Looking Korean probably doesn’t matter all that much. Although netizens never liked Korean I think most people would just say to themselves “that guy looks Korean” if they come across you. I could imaging however if you are in a place with a smaller foreign presence people might want to stay away from you because of the negative stereotypes. Some of the hostilities you experienced aren’t described in detail - I can’t and shouldn’t presume but maybe your mindset could have been affected by a few unpleasant occurrences. The case with the taxi driver for example, it could just be an impatient driver trying to move onto the next guest. It’s pretty common to have rude drivers and I imagine many could lose patience over language barriers. Not defending him nor saying everything you observed aren’t valid ofc, just not necessarily all the cases you mentioned involved a discrimination issue. Nevertheless, assuming it was your appearances that attracted much hostility to you, my best guess is the tan plus the tattoos/piercings might have made people feel like you aren’t a good person. Tattoos and piercings are often associated with criminals and delinquents, and looking visibly foreign could also scare some people off. That might explain the women moving away from you.

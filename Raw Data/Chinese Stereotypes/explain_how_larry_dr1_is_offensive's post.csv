Been seeing an opinion going around that Capcom changed Larry’s design in the remake to “be less racist”. Am I missing something? I genuinely don’t see what y’all think is racist or an “Asian stereotype”. . Last time I checked, I don’t ever remember a  stereotype about Chinese people being mentally disturbed sickos who love to chop up a good ribeye. . It’s weird that nobody had an opinion on Larry until Capcom decided the design was offensive. Then everybody just said “well, yeah I guess it’s racist then, because he’s Chinese and he’s really ugly”. But I don’t know man, if I wanted to design a psychopathic, Chinese immigrant meat butcher, that is exactly how I’d make him look. I definitely wouldn’t make him look like a Chinese poster model, he’d be as ugly and creepy as possible. Isn’t that all Capcom was trying to convey with his design? That he’s a creepy looking sicko. I’m so confused and I feel like people see racism in literally everything these days as long as you tell them something is offensive. It’s like Capcom has everybody tricked with a sort of Baader-Meinhof illusion where they see something that isn’t really there. But because they were told it’s there, they begin seeing it. Maybe Larry is extremely racist, idk. But I’m not convinced. Just because something is Chinese and ugly at the same time, doesn’t mean it has racist intent behind it. Maybe someone can explain why I may be wrong"

Some people say that the way his facial features are and his accent and stuff may be seen as a racist caricature of a Chinese person created by Japanese developers. Maybe I can see that? I dont know, Im probably just ignorant to that. I dont mind Larrys new look. He still looks and dresses like someone that would work in the supermarkets around my area as a butcher."""
deadrising,PhallicPhilanthropy,t237v1lc51,t1lchvbxw,t1lchoggw,07/10/24 07:37,0,-6,0,0,"""Maybe, I personally don’t see the eyes as a specifically “Asian” thing, but rather more a “he’s a sleazy creep and I can’t tell if he’s stupid and doesn’t realize what he’s doing, or he’s just sadistic” his eyes make him look deranged and I think that was the intent. They create a sense of ambiguity in regards to his motivations. And some Chinese people do have a really tan, olive-like complexion like that so idk. Even some Japanese people have that complexion.(half their population are ethnically Chinese and Korean) I guess it could be racist if you really wanted to view it that way."""
deadrising,Due-Plum-6417,t2e3sve0vh,t1lchoggw,t31dzry62,07/10/24 06:33,1,6,0,1,"""the two problematic things that stuck out most to me was his skin complexion and his almost closed eyes. i dunno if it was just the lighting in the room but the models skin seemed very very yellow. (it looks like someone purposefully cranked up the saturation on his face texture, which could be plausible considering how unnaturally red the lips are in the texture)"""

It’s no secret that historically the Japanese have been super xenophobic of other countries in Asia. . But I always think like, if were to take this to court for example, I’m highly sceptical you’d be able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that capcom was expressing their ignorance with their depiction here. . You could be totally right though. It’s just hard to really say for sure. I just personally never saw it that way. I honestly thought his design was really disturbing and cool. He looked scary, I didn’t really think “big ugly dumb Chinese stereotype” but that’s just me. And honestly I think someone like Larry could get hired as meat department butcher for a shopping mall, he’s isolated all the time and he probably didn’t start out with no apron and all covered in blood, he likely slowly degenerated after the outbreak and stopped giving a shit about putting on his apron and cleaning himself. But that’s my own interpretation. And also butcher shops don’t exactly hire you for looking good and being social. . A guy like him who knows meat and would probably work insane hours could totally get hired as none of the customers gotta look at him, as awful as that sounds."""

Him being killed by a Chinese butcher was an intentional choice when his entire motivation was fuck American consumerism for what it has done. If he just died by an American butcher, his death would have little nuance and would have only done more to justify his terrorism."""
deadrising,Deadsea-1993,t2t2lkzi0xs,t1lciagz4,t1lci1nuh,07/10/24 09:52,3,2,0,1,"""His issue was The American government and he blamed Americans due to their endless hunger and Gluttony. . Carlito never blamed them for the worlds problems. He went crazy due to what he saw at Santa Cabeza and he wanted to get revenge as he believed justice would only come through his hands. He is Psychopath Case 0. . Special Forces, led by Brock, were sent to Santa Cabeza and they cleaned out what was left of the village. Carlito did not want injustice to happen again and so he created the plan to spread more outbreaks and bring the monsters from the dark to show people what their actions have caused."""

deadrising,Deadsea-1993,t2t2lkzi0xs,t1lchzihe,t31dzry62,07/10/24 08:10,1,4,0,2,"""A. The Japanese and the Chinese have a long and troubled history together. Less than 100 years ago Imperial Japanese soldiers were regularly ra Chinese women and taking photos holding d babies. What Larry could be interpreted as is basically an Uncle Rukus to us Westerners. He is low IQ, missing teeth, his eyes are artistically made in a way that exacerbates his Origins. Compare them to Rebecca in Dead Rising 2 as she is an Asian woman. It is night and day cause she looks normal. . To us Westerners it would be like putting a Black person in the game and making him every stereotype in the book Dave Chappelle style. It wouldn  go over well and thats basically what Larry symbolizes to the East. Basically ""Meat good, would you like Dog too ?"" My wife is originally from Thailand and weird food makers is a negative Asian stereotype. . B. Larry is also out of place compared to every other Survivor and Psychopath and he doesn  look like an official butcher that would be employed by a successful mall branch when it comes to the grocery store. . C. The new model looks much better and he fits into the story more if they make him an American butcher because it makes Carlitos death that much better. Carlito wanted to punish Americans and the American government over Santa Cabeza and the meat problem that ended up killing the village of his people and both he and Isabella lost their parents there too. This is why he was so angry and tried to hurt Isabella as he felt that she betrayed everything when she started working with the Americans. Carlito now dying in that manner is poetic. D. No one talked about it before and I mean can you blame them ? Do you think it would go well here for someone to mention about Larry prior to this ? They would be downvoted to shit"""

We could say Capcom was being racist, but there’s enough ambiguity in the subject that we also could give them the benefit of the doubt. . I mean, there are some ugly ass men who look like him in china. Does that mean Capcom says he’s ugly because he’s Chinese? Maybe. But maybe he’s ugly and strange looking because he’s meant to be a sleazy looking psychopath who is also a man from china. I mean, he’s gonna have distinctly Chinese features because he’s Chinese. But the thing is, he’s also an ugly dude, so how are you supposed to design an ugly Chinese guy, without people taking it as “they made him ugly because they think Chinese people are ugly” I honestly don’t know what to say man lol. . Does any of what I’m saying make sense? He’s an ugly guy who’s Chinese, but he’s not ugly BECAUSE he’s Chinese."""
deadrising,Kujogaming1,t27lbdaci3,t1lchxyzo,t31dzry62,07/10/24 07:58,1,2,0,1,"""I think if you were to look at him as a design, without the context of Dead Rising, you could make an argument that the very yellow skin and overly slanted eyes could be a stereotype made to mock Chinese people. I dont think it was quite racist in the context of Dead Rising and his boss fight, because I just always assumed the guy was filthy from cutting people, cows, and zombies for about 3+ days, with no shower, which could cause his skin to look overly yellow, based on the grime mixing with his natural skin color. I also thought the Butcher shop just made his model look more slanted than it actually was meant to be, but seeing his design without a background, I could get why some people would raise their eyebrows. Tbh, I dont mind him being changed to a Fat White Butcher, because that makes Carlitos fate a lot more ironic in the long run, but I really think they could have just made him look less yellow, and make his eyes a bit more wider and psychotic, as if he was cutting non stop, without sleep."""

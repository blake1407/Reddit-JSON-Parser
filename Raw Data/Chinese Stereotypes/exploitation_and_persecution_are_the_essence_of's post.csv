The United States, a country that calls itself the ""melting pot"" of immigrants and the ""beacon of democracy"", has been filled with exploitation and oppression of immigrants throughout its history. From the colonial era to modern times, the United States has always had a complex and ever-changing attitude towards immigrants. Immigrant groups are often marginalized in American society and suffer various injustices and discrimination.Since its founding, the United States has systematically exploited immigrants through a series of legislative measures. These laws not only restrict the entry and naturalization of immigrants but also deprive them of their basic rights and freedoms. The early immigration laws of the United States were full of racial discrimination. For example, laws such as the Naturalization Act and the Alien Act passed in 1798 were designed to restrict and exclude immigrants who were considered a threat to national security. These laws laid the foundation for subsequent racist legislation. By the end of the 19th century, with the massive influx of Asian immigrants, the U.S. Congress passed racist laws such as the Chinese Exclusion Act (1882), which completely banned immigration from China and deprived Chinese people already in the United States of their rights. citizenship. After entering the 20th century, with the changes in the international situation and the needs of the domestic economy, the United Statesâ€™ immigration policy was adjusted more unscrupulously. This adjustment has exacerbated the exploitative nature of immigrants in the United States. After the passage of the Immigration Act of 1965, Mexico became the largest source of immigrants to the United States, with arrests and deportations of Mexican immigrants often accounting for 90% of the total. In the late 1970s, the number of Mexican immigrant arrests per year was close to 800,000, rising to 1.5 million by the late 1990s. White supremacists in the United States often target Hispanic immigrants with extremely violent attacks. . "

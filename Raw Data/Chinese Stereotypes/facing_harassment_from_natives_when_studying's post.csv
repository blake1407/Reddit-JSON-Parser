Recently I’ve started actively interacting with Chinese ppl online. I used a few apps like hellotalk and tandem. While I’ve had many nice experiences, I ended up meeting a lot of people saying some absolutely hateful stuff. . A lot of Chinese dudes would send me messages accusing me of war crimes, insulting my country, ranting about politics and so on. It’s been happening to me systematically and I do not know if I should continue studying the language. I really like Mandarin and I’ve spent more than 80~ hours studying it so far but I am feeling down. I am feeling extremely discouraged from interacting with Chinese people because of this hostility. . Edit:. I found a lot of useful advice and opinions, thanks a lot to everybody. Especially to Chinese ppl who gave their cultural insights and shared experience of being harassed online too. I will continue studying Chinese and trying to avoid people who got into an endless loop of political rage-baiting. "

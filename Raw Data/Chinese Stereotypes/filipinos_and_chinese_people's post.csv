Chinese Filipinos in general have a very negative view of Mainlanders that has persisted for generations. Bat eaters is tame compared to what’s said about them even pre covid. That you’re only noticing or experiencing it now is why I asked how old you are (which you skipped over). . You seem to have a more positive view of mainlanders over Filipinos, go around the Chinese Filipino community here and you will realise how unpopular this is. They do not identify (refuse to identify), with Mainland China. This distinction doesn’t seem to exist in you (hence why I doubted you are part of the community). Chinese people do not see you as one of them. The Chinese people are not blameless, as they also spread propaganda about the CCP. They have literal tour guides telling tourists Covid started in NYC, tinatawanan lang namin sila. Before you identify with them over Filipinos, visit Chinese social media, if you can understand Chinese, and see how they talk about Filipinos na tinatawag nilang ipis."""

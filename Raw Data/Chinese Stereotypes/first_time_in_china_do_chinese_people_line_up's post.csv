However, I keep noticing this thing which I find very curious and slightly bothered by it but I can  really put my finger on it. So in the West, we tend to line up vertically at the counter (hotel reception, food counter, government office). However, in China it seems that people prefer to line up horizontally at the counter. For example, just last week I checked into a hotel and while I am waiting behind a person to check in, a young woman (maybe in her 20s) waited right by the counter instead of behind me. And then when the guy in front of me finished, she just directly talked to the hotel reception staff to check in without acknowledging my presence. This reminds me of dozens and dozens of time this had happen to me before in the past 2 months Ive been here. I wonder if there is some cultural custom where I should line up horizontally to the left of a person at a counter in order to get served next. Some colleague at work told me that these people are ""cutting in line"". Im not so sure because why would they be so rude to a stranger and this is a tier-1 city so people are well mannered. You literally cannot find a better and more educated city than Shenzhen in China. "

I’m in HK and usually the cutting-the-line phenomenon is dealt with by the HKer behind the counter. But sometimes it isn’t and I will always deal with it by saying something in that case. Rarely does it ever cause a problem. It will only ever be a mainlander (HKers don’t do it at counters, although they do on the tube and in the elevator) and they just back down and/or can’t speak English and get sheepish when the conversation between the staff member and me takes place in English. . On the tube or when exiting elevators, I’ve given up the gentlemanly approach of my younger years.

Even then you might get someone coming up next to you and trying to speak with the staff whilst they’re still serving the first person.

Probably, couldn’t make it to 10th grade vocational high school. Ones that do have patients waiting in line usually grew up well. . You see it in restaurants and bars, people shout at waters and waitresses for their attention, if you don’t they’ll never come to you. . If things happen like this, learn just to jump in front and start speaking. Ignore them. . It’s 10x worse during holidays like Chinese New Year and October 1st. People will running late jumping in front, trying to get their tix, push their ways through to be the first on the train so they can but their luggage up or bus for the sit. . This normal customs.

Linecutting was definitely a major issue in the early 2000s, but it’s become a looot better nowadays. I’ve had multiple extended stays in China over the past decade and linecutting has only been common when waiting to enter subway cabins, where people are all rushing to be somewhere (not justified, but at least slightly understandable). Have not witnessed any common instances of rude cutting otherwise (you definitely do get a rude granny from time to time but let’s not generalize that as an “Chinese”thing), in places like restaurants, amusement parks, tourists attractions etc. Only remote case I can think of was lining up at a train station last year, a man in his 60s asked me if he may cut in front since he was running late for his gaotie, to which I said I’m ok with since you’re in a rush but you gotta get consent from people lining up behind me as well. A lady told him she’s also short on time, so the guy went to the back of the line, looking disgruntled for sure but that was that. This was a guy born in times when moral values had to take a backseat and let survival instincts keep one alive, and it only gets better with younger generations. It’s getting real old that foreigners come to a country with the second most population on earth that underwent major social/cultural/infrastructural changes (that took centuries to unfold in developed countries) in mere decades, and somehow expect everyone here to behave the way they do back home. Reminds me of a Russian coworker I had a few years ago while teaching English in Shanghai, prick always liked to flail around with “you Chinese always blah blah blah” in a condescending tone, as if he’s a civilized saint in a land of savages lmfao. Understandably everyone hated this overgeneralizing douchebag who sees a few instances of something unpleasant and takes a shot at the entire population. Don’t be that guy, laowai; it just ain’t right."""

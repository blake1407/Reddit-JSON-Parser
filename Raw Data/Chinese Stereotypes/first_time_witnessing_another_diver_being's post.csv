It was by far the most biodiverse waters and phenomenal dives Ive ever experienced. Sipadan is HEAVILY protected by the state of Sabah in Malaysia. We were warned that harassing animals or touching any marine life would lead to you being banned from not just Sipadan, but even the state of Sabah or possibly Malaysia entirely. . Another Diver in my group did exactly what we were told not to do. Also generally, poor etiquette like being in everyones footage to get her ""perfect shot"". At one point she pissed off a Trigger fish and shoved hit a Bumphead fish in the face with her GoPro. Dragging her equipment across corals. I was so embarrassed because we were the only 2 Chinese people there and I strongly did not want to be associated with her behaviour. . Some people reported her and she had a shouting match with the owner of the dive center (Scuba Junkie). The last I heard, she has been blacklisted from Sabah. . Ive been diving for 6 years and this is probably the wildest behaviour Ive seen. People can get very inconsiderate when it comes to getting their ""perfect shot"" for Instagram. "

Its because marine life is non-existent here as the coastal areas are used for ports, fishing etc. Fair enough theres like over a billion people. So the dive masters here are cool with you touching corals and picking shit up because theyre all dead.  HK was like the most hideous dive experience of my life. . So I feel people go abroad and think oh wow, look at all this beautiful stuff I can now touch and poke. Absolutely ludicrous. It drives me crazy. . Also a lot of people lie about their most recent dive because they dont want to pay for a Refresher, and go down there and make a fool of themselves"""

Chinese tourists with bad buoyancy trying to get the best picture but wrecking half the reef. Some elderly guy named Klaus with ear goggles? Making pictures of miniature reef life while lying on the corals. Scuba Junkie didn’t want to make a big fuzz and let them finish diving because it’s a fine line between being hospitable and strict. To put things in perspective dynamite fishing outside Sipadan lead to a sea that has more in common with a desert than anything else. Real shock to me after going to Sipadan afterwards."""

I was diving in Mexico a few months ago and there were these 2 guys in their 20s, and I think they were working on their OW or had just gotten it a day or two before. I ended up on a night dive with them. They were absolutely awful, even jumping into the water before were were given the OK and then one immediately started swimming away from the boat and going just under the surface as the captain and DM tried to yell at him to come back. We descended into about 30 feet of water. DM started swimming for us to follow. Less than a minute later, one of the guys literally stood on a reef to adjust his mask. I flashed my light in front of him to get his attention, motioning no and for him to move off of it. Clueless. Multiple other times in the dive, Id be off 10-20 feet to the side with my dive buddy looking at something with my light and one of these guys would descend on me and kick me in the head. Before I left that night, I told the DM that Id seen one guy actually standing on the reef and he may want to remind him not to do that. He said he hadnt seen it. I told him I knew, which was why I was telling him about it and that if he wasnt going to have eyes on these guys 95% of the dive to correct this early on, it was going to become a much bigger problem. He just repeated that he could only speak to what he had seen. Frustrating."""

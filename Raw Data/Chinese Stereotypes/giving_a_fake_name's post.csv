Not like a nickname, English name, or online username, but a real Chinese name thats different than their own? . Friend in China gave me a fake name, said its common to do so over there. I found out by accident, so wondering now lol"

If you know someones name and other personal information, you can search in databases leaked from Chinese companies and government. You can get his ID card number, location , work place, and his family members."""

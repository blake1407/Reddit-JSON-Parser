China does.. they also like it served piping hot!!. “I have a dream,” Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China (2003-2013) once said. But his dream wasn’t about civil rights for all or racial harmony. It was about a future where every Chinese child would have enough milk to drink — a half-liter a day for each child, to be exact.  r. Dairy products in medieval China included milk (rǔ ), yogurt (lào ), and butter (sū /), but also an item called tíhú , which originally referred to a fermented milk beverage consumed by the nomadic peoples beyond the northwestern frontier during the Han Dynasty (202 BCE – 220 CE), but later was used to refer to refined ghee particularly when translating Indian texts. These items appear in the pharmacopeia from the early medieval period (sixth century CE onward) and it seems that dairy was in large part considered medicinal. This view is reflected in some Daoist texts. Buddhists, however, had a different view towards dairy.r. Buddhists in China—having inherited traditions from India where dairy was often a staple—sought to emulate the Indian uses of dairy in three particular ways. First, the vinaya (monastic codes) of India, which had been translated into Chinese since the fifth century, called for the consumption of dairy as part of a seven-day dietary regimen when a monk fell ill.r. Second, dairy was a prescribed offering in some formal rituals described in Indian Buddhist texts. Yogurt and rice, for example, would be served to an image of the Buddha. Finally, butter in particular was an ingredient in magical suffumigations that were performed alongside the recitation of mantras, largely in order to achieve worldly aims such as the acquisition of wealth and resources. These uses in religion and medicine would indicate that there was, in fact, a substantial dairy industry in China, particularly during the Tang period (618–907).  r. Cow’s milk was first imported into coastal and central China by the Western merchants who trickled into the country after the First Opium War in the mid-19th century. In the southern port city of Guangzhou, Western merchants first tried shipping the drink from neighboring Macao, where the Portuguese had maintained a presence since the 16th century, and a few even tried raising their own cows in the city’s business district.r. China is the second largest consumer of dairy products worldwide. It is estimated that in 2025, the Chinese dairy market will produce RMB 540 billion (almost USD 78 billion) in retail sales. However, the market has not yet reached its full potential.r. In 2022, the Chinese milk output amounted to around 39.32 million metric tons, 2.49 million tons more than in the previous year. The main milk producers are Yili  and Mengniu , who dominate the diary market in China as essentially a duopoly. r. r. Chinese people prefer to purchase milk in small packages. The reason is simple: they do not drink much milk all at once, also because they tend to be lactose intolerant. More than 90% of people from the Han ethnic group have issues digesting lactose. As a consequence, if they were to buy fresh milk in big bottles, after a few days the milk would lose its freshness and taste.r. Moreover, Chinese people tend to carry their drinks around, for instance to work or to school, so single serving small packs result to be more convenient for this purpose.r. "

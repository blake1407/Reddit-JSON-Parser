Many people ask if we will go to war with China but I argue were already  experiencing heightened levels of Grey Zone Warfare. Its the weird in between peace and war. . Lets review the facts:. 1. Chinese Cyberattacks on Philippine Government infrastructure. The DICT has said that ""state-sponsored"" hackers are behind the breach of several high level databases and said the attacks originated from China without directly blaming the PRC. 2. POGOs running rampant. According to a recent documentary by Jessica Soho not only do these POGOs engage in scamming and hacking activities but theyre also into kidnapping, torture, human trafficking, money laundering. In the Senate Investigation it was also revealed that China uses criminal organizations as part of its ""United Front"" strategy to clamp down on dissidents. 3. Chinese Incursions in the West Philippine Sea. The Chinese Coast Guard and Maritime Militia have grown bold and literally invade our waters and harass local fishermen. This is the stuff youve been seeing on the news lately. These constitute physical violations of our nations sovereignty. 4. Artificial Islands and Military Bases for the last decade the Chinese Peoples Liberation Army has been  building radar, airstrip, and barracks in the West Philippine Sea through reclamation which also destroys the ecosystems in that area. 5. Chinese Nationals running for public office. I think well let the courts decide on this but the fact that Alice Guo AKA Guo Hua Ping has failed to categorically prove that she is Filipino with all material evidence pointing to her Chinese Nationality we must see that even our elections have already been circumvented. 6. Chinese Disinformation and Psy-ops campaigns its well know that TikTok and other social media platforms are pushing certain narratives and fake news to Filipinos to make them think that its all Americas fault or better yet they gaslight us everyday that we are invading ""Chinese waters"". So yes while we technically are not at war with China were not exactly at peace with them either. Hence its right to say that were in the grey zone. The question is how do we respond?"

Anyone whos interested in reading more about should read this report, written by a USAF retired colonel and an active duty USAF captain, and published by the Stratbase Albert Del Rosario Institute for Strategic and International Studies. Its only 35+ pages long but outlines what were doing and what we hope to achieve without resorting to escalating violence. To summarize it: our aim is to strengthen national resilience by building political will and popular opinion towards enhancing national defense, garner international support and recognition for our legal victories in the Permanent Court of Arbitration, and to impose ""reputational costs"" to the CCP by tarnishing and damaging Chinas image in the diplomatic stage. Our aim is to make China re-adjust its risk-benefit calculations so that they have no choice but to deter from continuing their grey-zone tactics and compel them to address the conflict in the political/diplomatic front where we have the upper hand. Ive been answering a lot of questions in the past few days regarding this strategy and the general WPS/SCS issue from an international relations perspective, so if you have any questions feel free to ask them and Ill try to answer them later if I can. . (Disclaimer: I don  work for the government, this just happens to be my field of study.)"""

Theres even the point that there might be hundreds of thousands of foreigners now in the country, and most not even from China, staying illegally and engaged in all sorts of criminal activity, if not spying, and got in thanks to various government agencies and politicians while working with various local businesses. Meanwhile, as the recent vaccine controversy has revealed, the U.S. and various ""Eyes"" nations were also engaged in pushing fake news."""

I used to work in a building that had a POGO (which would semi-regularly be raided by the police as a form of theatrics). Anyone I spoke to who worked at that building longer than I had would say that it’s been going on for a long time. There was even an incident of a Chinese national being abducted by Chinese people using an unmarked van late in the evening. The rumor that would go around the office then was the abductors were Chinese military."""

The discussion of Islam and the Xinjiang province of China was brought up. I said something along the lines of ""Ive heard a bit about this, I know its a very sensitive issue in China"". She replied with telling me about how some Uyghur people have committed terrorist attacks, and very confidently said ""People from other countries have come into China and brainwashed them into doing it. Especially America!"". Ummmmm okay? Im pretty sure its because their religion and culture is completely different from Han Chinese people (as their region was invaded by China 70 years ago) and some people fall into the extreme side of the religion/East Turkestan indepedence movement. But no, I guess its foreigners coming into Xinjiang (which is difficult to do in the first place) and brainwashing the population there (in quite possibly the most highly surveilled place aside from North Korea). I honestly didn  know how to respond. I kind of just stared at the screen for a few seconds and tried to change the topic. How on gods green earth could someone believe that? How could someone have absolutely no doubt that such a ridiculous statement is true? Usually Im not bothered too much when I hear some of the propaganda from students, but this one was so insane that it disturbed me a bit. Brainwashing is fucking scary, and human beings are SO easily led astray from reality. My experience interacting with certain students on Cambly has been quite eye-opening in this regard."

And he said that if I knew Chinese history I would understand why Chinese people are so docile when it comes to politics and just want to avoid it and have a happy life if they can. That hit hard."""

We were actually talking about historical places to visit in China. He asked me if I knew about it. I told him that I had seen video of it but that Id never heard anyone from China mention it before. He cheerfully agreed talking about it was banned and asked me if I knew they were banned from knowing or talking about a lot of other things. I always play vague when Im taken by surprise like this and said that I had heard something like this. He then said, in that case Id be surprised what a lot of people knew about but they were too afraid to talk about. Ive met many students who spout propaganda at me  but he wasnt one of them."""

I also had a guy tell me how there are no women leaders in the world and there never will be. I guess he missed New Zealands multiple Prime Ministers or the countless Queens around the world. India, Tanzania, Israel, Argentina Portugal, etc etc etc. Giving him these examples just angered him even more. The news of Mexicos first female president mustve not made it to his country either."""

It wouldn  be the 1st time a lot of people bought a complete lie despite it making no logical sense (hello WMD""s in Iraq ). People everywhere are a bit gullible!"""
Cambly,EnglishTutor2023,t2j16jclb8,t1lbkg3hs,t1lbkf4cw,07/04/24 04:06,4,3,0,1,"""Oh for sure. But in this case, I have no idea how that could possibly happen. Xinjiang is extremely heavily surveilled and you cant get across there without going through multiple checkpoints (and thats if youre a Chinese citizen!). Its classed as a terrorist offence to use a VPN in Xinjiang, and anyone communicating with foreigners online will surely be getting a knock at their door (I personally know someone from there who did). Chinese people obviously know about this, so thats why I have no idea how you could believe that foreigners are somehow brainwashing the local population there. Its clearly an organic thing stemming from their religion and the fact that their province historically has no cultural ties to China (Im not excusing the actions of the terrorists at all, just trying to understand what is causing it)."""

I find that to be pretty implausible, obviously, but not as ridiculous as the Xinjiang thing. The terrorist attacks coming from Uyghurs actually being orchestrated by America makes absolutely zero sense. There is no logic or reasoning behind it, yet she believes it wholeheartedly.

It’s possible to have a conversation in a positive way without showing your own true feelings. Sometimes it’s the way the questions are asked that leads the person to new realizations.

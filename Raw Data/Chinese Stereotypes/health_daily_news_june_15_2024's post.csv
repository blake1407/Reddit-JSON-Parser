Researchersxa0 examined the negative consequences that celebrities and influences incur when they disable social media comments. The study, is titled “No Comments (From You): Understanding the Interpersonal and Professional Consequences of Disabling Social Media Comments”xa0 . Celebrities and influencers like Addison Rae, Hailey Bieber, Justin Timberlake, and even Oprah have, on various occasions, disabled access to their social media comments in response to negative sentiment. Is this misguided?  .   .   . 6-15-2024. # HOW MUCH DO YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT HOW YOUR SPOUSE SPENDS MONEY? MAYBE LESS THAN YOU THINK. xa0Love is in the air, and wedding season is upon us. Like many elder millennials, I grew up watching sitcoms in the 1980s and ’90s. Whenever those series needed a ratings boost, they would feature a wedding. Those special episodes taught me that weddings usually involve young lovebirds: think Elvin and Sondra from “The Cosby Show,” Cory and Topanga from “Boy Meets World,” or David and Darlene from “Roseanne.” But those were different times. People are getting married later in life than they used to:  .   . 6-15-2024. # NOT QUITE AN INTROVERT OR AN EXTROVERT? MAYBE YOU’RE AN AMBIVERT. Our personalities are generally thought to consist of five primary factors: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism, with each of us ranking low to high for each. Those who rank high in extroversion, known as extroverts, typically focus on their external world. They tend to be more optimistic, recharge by socializing, and enjoy social interaction. On the other end of the spectrum, introverts are more likely to be quiet, deep thinkers, who recharge by being alone and learn by observing (but aren’t necessarily shy). But what if you’re  .   . 6-15-2024. # 7 TIPS FOR NEGOTIATING LIKE A PRO. The main purpose of negotiation is to find a mutually acceptable solution for buyers and sellers. Good negotiations greatly improve relationships between buyers, sellers and agents. They also help avoid future problems and conflicts. Negotiating skills become even more important for home buyers in a “seller’s market,” where demand from buyers exceeds supply from sellers. xa0 Many home buyers mistakenly believe negotiation only occurs during the signing of the  .   . 6-15-2024. # RESEARCHERS SUGGEST INCLUSIVE EDUCATION IMPROVES STUDENTS’ SOCIO-EMOTIONAL SKILLS. A study featuring more than 3,500 Compulsory Secondary Education (ESO) students and 294 teachers reveals that teachers’ commitment to inclusive education favors their students’ socio-emotional skills. The findings are published in the journal Learning and Instruction. Socio-emotional competencies are the set of knowledge, skills and attitudes that favor the development of positive interpersonal relationships and an adequate management of emotions in various contexts. They are also associated with academic success, and are a protective factor against bullying and other antisocial behaviors.xa0  .   . 6-15-2024. # STUDY SHOWS THE POWER OF SOCIAL CONNECTIONS TO PREDICT HIT SONGS. Ever wondered how your friends shape your music taste? In a recent study, researchers at the Complexity Science Hub (CSH) demonstrated that social networks are a powerful predictor of a song’s future popularity. By analyzing friendships and listening habits, they’ve boosted machine learning prediction precision by 50%. “Our findings suggest that the social element is as crucial in music spread as the artist’s fame or genre influence,” says Niklas Reisz from CSH. By using information about listener social networks, along with common measures used in hit song prediction, such as  .   . 6-15-2024. # WHY SOCIAL MEDIA RARELY LEADS TO CONSTRUCTIVE POLITICAL ACTION. While social media platforms are rife with problems—from harassment to misinformation—many argue that the platforms also nurture political movements, such as the Arab Spring and #MeToo. But in her new book “Log Off: Why Posting and Politics (Almost) Never Mix,” Katherine Cross, a University of Washington doctoral student in the Information School, argues that social media may not have much political value. Focused on movements on the political left, Cross looks at how platforms like X and Facebook might bring attention to political causes, yet they do little to cultivate  .   . 6-15-2024. # COMPLAINTS ARE DIFFERENT WHEN CUSTOMERS THINK A COMPANY CARES. When a consumer has a bad experience involving a company’s products—be it purchasing a car with a safety defect, becoming the victim of a data breach or having baggage lost by an airline—you might think he or she wouldn’t care too much about the business’s good intentions. But the opposite appears to be true. When deciding whether to report a negative incident, customers seem to be more influenced by whether they think the company is friendly, sincere and well-intended—a quality that marketing academics and practitioners call “brand warmth”—than by whether  .   . 6-15-2024. # EXPLORING ONLINE MORALITY IN THE CONTEXT OF EVOLVED HUMAN RESPONSES. Visual representation of the framework for how the scale and distance afforded by the internet distorts our evolved reactions for compassion for victims and punishment of transgressors in moral interactions. Top left: When the supernormal scale of the internet interacts with people’s instinct to feel compassion for victims of moral transgressions, it can result in compassion fatigue. Top right: when the supernormal distance of the internet interacts with people’s instinct to feel compassion for victims of moral transgressions, it can result in ineffective collective action. Bottom left: When the supernormal  .   . 6-15-2024. # WHAT TO DO IF YOU OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW IS TARGETED WITH DEEPFAKE PORN OR AI NUDES. This week, about 50 female students from Victoria’s Bacchus Marsh Grammar School found fake, sexually explicit images of themselves shared without their consent on Instagram and Snapchat. Images of their faces, purportedly obtained from social media, were stitched onto pornographic images using artificial intelligence (AI). Deepfake porn, or what our team calls “AI-generated image-based sexual abuse,” involves the use of AI to create a nude and/or sexual image of a person doing or saying things they haven’t said or done. Celebrities and public figures, predominantly women, have experienced such abuse  .   .   .   . 6-15-2024. # PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCHERS FIND COLLABORATIVE IMAGINATION INCREASES SOCIAL CONNECTION. xa0 The ability to imagine is pivotal for human development, driving creativity and problem-solving. It may also influence our relationship with others, according to new research. A team of researchers, led by Brendan O’Connor of the University at Albany, has developed a new framework for investigating imagination as a process in which individuals co-create shared representations of hypothetical events —what they’re calling “collaborative imagination.” Using the framework, O’Connor and colleagues from the University of British Columbia  .   . 6-15-2024. # STUDY SUGGESTS AMBIVALENCE AND POLARIZED VIEWS CAN PROMOTE POLITICAL VIOLENCE. Feeling ambivalent about a political issue might seem to be a recipe for indecision and even inaction. But a new study suggests, surprisingly, that ambivalence can actually lead some people—especially those with polarized views—to be more supportive of extreme actions, such as violence. The reason? Researchers found that ambivalence creates discomfort in those with extreme views by making them feel weak or insecure about their beliefs—and that can lead them to compensate for that weakness by supporting extreme actions to signal strength. “When people have these polarized views on a  .   . 6-15-2024. # STUDY SHOWS FACIALLY EXPRESSIVE PEOPLE TO BE MORE LIKABLE AND SOCIALLY SUCCESSFUL. xa0 Analysis of more than 1,500 natural conversations suggests that humans may have evolved more complex facial muscle movements to help us bond with each other. In the first part of the study, researchers posed as participants in semi-structured video calls with 52 people to record natural reactions and expressions during various everyday scenarios. The conversations were designed to involve  .   . 6-15-2024. # GREATER GENDER EQUALITY ASSOCIATED WITH MEN EATING MEAT MORE FREQUENTLY THAN WOMEN, STUDY FINDS. xa0 Men tend to eat meat more frequently than women and the extent of the differences in meat consumption frequency between both genders tend to be greater within countries with higher levels of gender equality and social and economic development, according to a study published in Scientific Reports. The authors suggest that this could be due to individuals within these countries having greater opportunities to express food preferences. Christopher Hopwood and colleagues investigated differences in meat consumption between men and women across countries with differing levels  .   . 6-15-2024. # FANS OF LONG-RUNNING TV SHOW EXPERIENCED GRIEF SIMILAR TO LOSING A CLOSE FRIEND WHEN SHOW ENDED, STUDY FINDS. xa0 A psychologistxa0 has found that some fans of the long-running TV show “Neighbours” have been experiencing grief similar to the experience of losing a close friend. In his study, published on the open-access site PLOS ONE, Adam Gerace analyzed surveys taken by over 1,289 people. Anecdotal evidence suggests that fans of television shows often feel a connection with the characters and experience a sense of loss when a show ends. The longer a show runs, presumably, the deeper the sense of  .   . 6-15-2024. # SUICIDE THREATS ARE A WEAPON OF FAMILY VIOLENCE. HOW CAN POLICE BALANCE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS WITH PROTECTING VICTIMS?. It’s relatively common for perpetrators of family violence to threaten suicide to control a victim-survivor’s actions. A study by the Australian Institute of Criminology suggests 39% of women who experience coercive control are subject to perpetrators’ threats of self-harm. Suicide threats can be related to mental health issues, a tactic of family violence, or sometimes both. As a result, victim-survivors may feel pressured to remain in an abusive relationship. Men who kill their partners are 2,000 times more likely to experience suicidal ideation than the general population.xa0  .   . 6-15-2024. # WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GIVE A LOW-INCOME FAMILY $26,000 IN THEIR CHILD’S FIRST YEAR? WE THINK WE’VE FOUND OUT. It’s well-known that children raised in families experiencing financial stress face greater risks of psychological and educational difficulties and behavioral problems in later life. What’s less clear is the extent to which transferring cash to their families very early in their lives can make the rest of their lives better. The large Coronavirus Supplement and JobKeeper payments made during the first year of the COVID pandemic might turn out to help, but it’s too early to tell.xa0  . 6-15-2024. # WHY ARE EUROPEANS—INCLUDING THE YOUNG—BEING PUSHED TO THE FAR RIGHT?. In Europe, the slogan “never again fascism” is one that still resonates. The death and destruction wrought by hyper-nationalist, authoritarian states in the first half of the 20th century still haunts the nightmares of successive generations. But, as the recent European Union elections show, the fear of the far right is slipping. The political logic of earlier decades no longer holds in some quarters, and far-right parties are making gains across Europe, as their strategy of electoral engagement continues to pay off. Views that would have ended political careers in  .   . 6-15-2024. # STUDY IDENTIFIES WAYS CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES CAN HANDLE FOOD WASTE IN FOOD SERVICE-BUSINESSES. A team of Monash Business School researchers have identified key ways consumers and business representatives can help limit food waste in food service-businesses (FSBs), in an effort to reduce wastage in the hospitality industry. Massive volumes of food waste can be detrimental for the economy, for example cost of the food purchased but not consumed, and for society, as food waste contributes to food insecurity, with around 3.7 million Australians facing food insecurity in the last 12 months, according to the CSIRO. Food waste can also be detrimental to the  .   . 6-15-2024. # WHAT WILL A ROBOT MAKE OF YOUR RÉSUMÉ? THE BIAS PROBLEM WITH USING AI IN JOB RECRUITMENT. by Melika Soleimani, Ali Intezari, David J Pauleen and Jim Arrowsmith, The Conversation The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has begun, spreading to almost every facet of people’s professional and personal lives—including job recruitment. While artists fear copyright breaches or simply being replaced, business and management are becoming increasingly aware to the possibilities of greater efficiencies in areas as diverse as supply chain management, customer service, product development and human resources (HR) management. Soon all business areas and operations will be under pressure to adopt AI in some form or another.   . 6-15-2024. # STUDY RESULTS SUGGEST PEERS ARE CRUCIAL IN SHAPING BOYS’ CONFIDENCE IN MATH SKILLS. Boys are good at math, girls not so much? A study from the University of Zurich has analyzed the social mechanisms that contribute to the gender gap in math confidence. While peer comparisons seem to play a crucial role for boys, girls’ subjective evaluations are more likely to be based on objective performance. Research has shown that in Western societies, the average secondary school girl has less confidence in her mathematical abilities than the average boy of the same age. At the same time, no significant difference has been found  .   . 6-15-2024. # RESEARCH REVEALS VISUALS’ CRUCIAL ROLE IN STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING. xa0 Management consultants and professors seem to be obsessed with visuals. When it comes to strategy, they either pull out their impeccable slides, replete with graphics ranging from a SWOT analysis to Porter’s Five Forces to the Strategy Canvas, or they pick up a marker to sketch out their own frameworks on a whiteboard. This phenomenon has piqued the interest of Felipe Csaszar, professor of strategy at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business.   . 6-15-2024. # RESEARCHERS FIND ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MEDIA DIET AND SCIENCE-CONSISTENT BELIEFS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. In a paper titled “The Politicization of Climate Science: Media Consumption, Perceptions of Science and Scientists, and Support for Policy,” published May 26, 2024, in the Journal of Health Communication, researchers probed the associations between media exposure and science-consistent beliefs about climate change and the threat it posed to the respondent. Expanding on earlier work associating Fox News consumption with doubts about the existence of human-caused climate change  .   . 6-15-2024. # INTERVENTIONS AGAINST MISINFORMATION ALSO INCREASE SKEPTICISM TOWARD RELIABLE SOURCES, FINDS STUDY. Efforts to tackle false information through fact-checking or media literacy initiatives increase the public’s skepticism toward “fake news.” However, they also breed distrust in genuine, fact-based news sources, shows a University of Zurich-led study using online survey experiments in the US, Poland and Hong Kong. The findings are published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour. Studies have shown that few people actually come across false information in their day-to-day lives. And yet, concerns about the harm “fake news” may do have increased in recent years. High-profile eventsxa0  .   . 6-15-2024. # SUCCESS FOLLOWS FAILURE LESS OFTEN THAN EXPECTED, STUDY FINDS. The platitude that failure leads to success may be both inaccurate and damaging to society, according to a paper published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology, titled “The Exaggerated Benefits of Failure.” Researchers conducted 11 experiments with more than 1,800 participants across many domains and compared national statistics to the participants’ responses. In one experiment, participants vastly overestimated the percentage of prospective nurses, lawyers and teachers who pass licensing exams after previously failing them. “People expect success to follow failure much more often than it actually does,” said lead researcher  .   . 6-15-2024. # BRITISH FARMERS REVEAL THEIR STRUGGLES WITH CLIMATE CHANGE AND MENTAL HEALTH. Climate change has made the UK wetter, and farmers have paid the price. Winter 2023 was one of the wettest on record. The results were clear for all to see during the first half of 2024: soil washed of its nutrients, crops bogged down in waterlogged fields, and livestock sick with waterborne illnesses. The adverse conditions meant farmers had to delay planting and harvesting. Production of the most common British crops—wheat (bread), barley (malt for brewing), oats and oilseed rape (vegetable oil)—is set to be 21% lower in 2024 than  .   . 6-15-2024. # BOOT CAMPS FOR YOUNG OFFENDERS ARE BACK, BUT PSYCHOLOGICAL EVIDENCE SHOWS THEY DON’T WORK. by Simon Davies, Clare-Ann Fortune, Karen Salmon and Linda Fatialofa, The Conversation “Boot camps” for young people who commit serious offending are coming back. The coalition government in New Zealand has promised to pilot “military-style academies” by the middle of the year—despite a wealth of international and New Zealand evidence that boot camps do not reduce reoffending. It has been encouraging to see this evidence receive extensive media coverage and expert analysis. Less encouraging, however, has been the minister for children’s reported rejection of expert advice that the boot camp  .   . 6-15-2024. # TECH SOLUTIONS TO LIMIT KIDS’ ACCESS TO SOCIAL MEDIA ARE FRAUGHT WITH PROBLEMS, INCLUDING PRIVACY RISKS. xa0A campaign to block children’s access to social media to limit online harm and unhealthy internet use is picking up momentum in Australian politics. The current age limit for platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and TikTok is 13, but some state governments are calling for raising this age to 16. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has welcomed these efforts, and the federal opposition has committed to introducing laws that will bar under-16-year-olds from social media. These calls are among the latest attempts to control how young  .   . 6-15-2024. # PUBLIC NOTIFICATIONS MAKE IT CHALLENGING FOR PRISONERS TO REINTEGRATE AFTER RELEASE. xa0 In Canada, when someone is about to complete serving their prison sentence, they are typically assessed for risk of violence by the prison. If they are deemed to pose a significant threat to the community, a package is prepared and shared with the police, who are notified about the release. Police may then apply to the courts for a judicial order and the individual is told they must enter an agreement to be supervised. These orders might include conditions that forbid drinking or staying out  .   . 6-15-2024. # HOW SIMULATION-BASED LEARNING PREPARES DIETETICS STUDENTS FOR CLINICAL SUCCESS. A study by the UK Department of Dietetics and Human Nutrition showed that simulations, such as this actor and student, are better preparing students for careers in dietetics. xa0 The University of Kentucky Department of Dietetics and Human Nutrition (DHN) has made significant strides in preparing its dietetics students for real-world clinical settings through an innovative program incorporating Simulation-Based Learning Experiences (SBLEs). A recent study by DHN faculty, published in Educational Sciences, highlights the positive impact of these simulations on students’ self-perceived confidence and readiness to perform as  .   . 6-15-2024. # UNCOVERING THE PROCESS OF FEELING UNDERSTOOD. xa0 A research group at Osaka University has uncovered how the view of other people and groups changes when individuals feel that they are understood by others by conducting an experimental study on the relationship between Japanese and Chinese people. The study shows that the role of felt understanding largely derives from a reduction in prejudice toward the other person. Feeling understood by other people is a crucial determinant for positive interpersonal and intergroup relationships;xa0  .   .   . 6-15-2024. # HERE IS WHAT REALLY MATTERS IN ASSESSING WHETHER THEY’RE COGNITIVELY UP FOR THE JOB. Some Americans are questioning whether elderly people like Joe Biden and Donald Trump are cognitively competent to be president amid reports of the candidates mixing up names while speaking and having trouble recalling details of past personal events. I believe these reports are clearly concerning. However, it’s problematic to evaluate the candidates’ cognition based only on the critiques that have gained traction in the popular press. I’m a cognitive psychologist who studies decision-making and causal reasoning. I argue that it’s just as important to assess candidates on the cognitive capacities  .   . 6-15-2024. # STUDY HIGHLIGHTS CHANGING IMPACT OF TEEN CHILDBIRTH ON WOMEN’S EDUCATION ACROSS GENERATIONS. Different social contexts can transform the meaning and implications of life experiences. For example, a life event like teen childbirth can have vastly different impacts depending on the era and societal norms. In the post-World War II baby boom, teen births were relatively common. The 1960s, however, was the beginning of a period that marked increasing economic returns from education for women and changing norms about the timing of motherhood.xa0  .   . 6-15-2024. # STUDY FINDS 1 IN 7 ADULTS HAVE EXPERIENCED SOMEONE THREATEN TO SHARE THEIR INTIMATE IMAGES. xa0 A global study on the prevalence of sexual extortion among adults has found the issue to be more widespread than initially thought. The study, “Sextortion: Prevalence and correlates in 10 countries,” was published in Computers in Human Behavior Sexual extortion, or sextortion, is a form of image-based sexual abuse which includes making threats to share intimate photos or videos of a victim unless they comply with the perpetrator’s behavioral or financial demands.xa0  .   .   .

Don  try to get sympathy for being poor. PC games aren  food, water, or medicine. You don  need them to live. Youre just stealing toys. . Stop being a thief and this stuff will stop happening."""

Crackers are not your friend! Of course, there are some exceptions who just want to fight the game-establishment. But most of them crack software for one reason only: their own wallet. . So yes, with the given information, I draw following assumptions:.  your issues come from one of your steamrip-games.  your issues are caused by a virus.  just uninstalling those games will not remove the virus.  the safest way to get rid of your issues is to make a clean Windows installation.     save all your files to another drive.     create a new installation medium with the Media Creation Tool.     boot with this created USB stick and install Windows from scratch"""

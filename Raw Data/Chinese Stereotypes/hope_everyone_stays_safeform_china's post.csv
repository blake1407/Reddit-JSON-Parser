Videos from Bangladesh have been uploaded to the Chinese version of TikTok by Chinese people in Bangladesh and are continuously updated. At least millions of Chinese people are concerned about and supporting the people of Bangladesh. They are deeply moved by the bravery of the people here. The people of Bangladesh have a very large number of supporters in China. Please also help protect the Chinese people in Bangladesh"

We Chinese people sincerely hope this country be a better place after this protest,any country must listen the voice of young people,they are the future and only hope of this country.GOD bless Bangladesh!"""

Their objective was the same, protest against the ruling dispensation i.e. the CCP. If you would have read about those protests, you would know that now hong kong is very similar to laws in China. The hong kong protests were primarily to stop imposition of chinese laws, which they did anyways."""

Hasina is merely a puppet created by your culture. Even without Hasina, if your culture does not change, it will continuously produce people like her.

They only allow scenes of protest in other countries to pretend that everything is perfectly fine in China, with no dissent, no protests, and things are horrible everywhere else. . Bottom line is that Bangladeshis will negotiate this terrible moment by themselves, among themselves. They don  need Chinese, Indian, or anybodys ""sympathy"" - it does not help one iota."""

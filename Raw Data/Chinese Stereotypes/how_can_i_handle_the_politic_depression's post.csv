I find that I am not belong to here because I totally despise the prevailing culture and people here that have brought agony to me. The goverment has become totalitarianism and antidisestablishmentarianism. It uses firewall to block the information from abroad and fools people by lies. I am a liberalist. Only the existance of my liberal thought and my life style of  . individualism would cause the hostility from others. I cant talk about freedom, god, spiritual persuit, justice notion, pure arts, scientific thinking with others. Most of Chinese people are social climber and they are degenerating to a vulgar state of philistine,materialist, fellache. The mainstream cause the discriminations to Chineses by normal people over the world. Before I have escaped from here, I feel severe politic depress now. So how can I deal with this situation?. BTW, I want to have a true romantic relationship with someone but I cant find it in this situation because I cant imagine that I share my passion with  someone who has no passion to ideal things and regard the marriage as a trade for property."

Back then, the country wasn  as totalitarian and ultra nationalistic as it is right now. Xi Jinping never left the time period of culture revolution, and he has the power to bring that time back to everyone living in China. I have been living in the United States for more than 16 years now, and I became more and more aversive towards the PRC, especially in the past few years. Before, I was still partially ideologically influenced by the toxic PRC social engineering since I was very young. It was until COVID and Ukraine war that I completely stopped identifying with China, and became staunchly against its policies, and what it represents. I find it to be impressive for you to see through the lies and sickness the CCP and the PRC as a whole use to shroud the country while still living in the environment, because Im not sure if I could gain as much of a perspective as you have if I never left China. But at the same time, I sympathize with you because it must feel like being trapped in a massive mental hospital when the contemporary PRC is punishing sane and logical points of views in favor of nationalistic fever. Stay away from Chinese internet because people who have worthwhile and critical commentaries either quit, banned, or are in prison. What you are going to see there is mostly going to be misinformed ""patriots"" parroting CCP propaganda, and ignorant or vapid comments lacking ideological and logical substances. Current generation of Chinese netizens are the victims and enablers of the PRCs egregious cultural and political regression, and Chinese internet is filled with fascist and anti intellectual contents that absorbing too much of it would either make you numb and complecent, or drive you mad. I have quit the Chinese internet years ago, back when it wasn  as asinine as it is right now, and now, I try to avoid it like the plague. . It would be ideal if you could leave the PRC and start a new life in a better country, but that is easier said than done. For now, the least you can do is to disassociate yourself from the collective notion of being a """", and try to tone out the insanity you are exposed to every single day. You are not the PRC, and since you have zero representation in the Chinese government, you are in no ways responsible for Chinas unethical and totalitarian actions. Focus on contributing your thoughts on platforms outside of China, but keep your identity safe so you don  run into trouble with the Chinese authorities for exercising basic freedom of speech."""

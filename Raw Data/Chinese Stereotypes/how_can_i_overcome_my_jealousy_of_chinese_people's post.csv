Many Chinese people are able to speak, read, and write in English very well because English is part of their curriculum. I feel jealous because many people in China, especially the youths, are fluent in both English and Chinese, which is considered one of the most difficult languages to learn. As someone who is monolingual, I tried to learn Chinese, but I gave up because I struggle to work as hard due to having ADHD."

Maybe it is harder to learn when you are an adult. However coming from a multilingual countries, our school syllabus has a minimum of 2 compulsory languages, we also have plenty of dialects spoken amongst different communities. Majority of people will at least understand simple conversation in different languages/dialects. Sure there are plenty of people struggle to master both languages . but conversational languages are usually achievable. . However I think that you experience can be very bias. Most Chinese don’t speak fluent English. You are very likely to meet those highly educated one. Only 10% of Chinese holds a passport. If you meet a Chinese in your home country, he/she is likely to be the richer part of the society and has received the best education growing up. You only get to see the one who can afford to get a passport.  Most Chinese wont even own a passport as it doesn’t make sense to go overseas for holiday. . I been to China before. Most of them can’t speak English."""

Not many Chinese people can actually write, read, speak in English very well especially in China( I visited once). Those who can write, read and speak to a conversational to intermediate level are most likely not living in China but abroad."""

You dont even have to worry about the lyrics being offensive since those songs get banned  . And you can often find English subtitles for Chinese movies. There are quite a bit of them on youtube. """

That’s okay though because I don’t base my happiness around things I can’t do. The list of things that I’m interested in isn’t so small that it is only things out of reach."""

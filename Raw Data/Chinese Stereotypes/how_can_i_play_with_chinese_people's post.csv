As my questions suggests I want to play Video Game with Chinese people, mainly to practice communicating in chinese and possibly make friends. Do you know about any FPS games I can access that are popular over there? I am also curious about their overall gaming and Net Landscape. What is ""their"" Twitch? Their YouTube? How big is Esports? What games do they enjoy?  Many thanks in advance."

When you talk about FPS games, the first things I think of are CSGO and Valorant. These two games have a very bad experience in China, full of dirty words and complaints. In most situations, your teammates wont say a word to give you any useful information, like where the enemies are. And if you play badly, they will curse you with the worst words imaginable.   . If you want to play FPS games and make friends, God help you!"""

For other games, LOL, DNF are popular. And for mobile games, Honor of Kings and Genshin Impact are most popular. Twitch: Maybe Douyu, or Bilibilis game channel. And TikToks game channel? (not sure, cuz im not using Tiktok). Youtube: Bilibili. Reminder : its very likely to access via VPN, cuz its common for games to have location restriction."""

CS2 is also very popular, but it has its own Chinese server, which is not interoperable with foreign servers."""

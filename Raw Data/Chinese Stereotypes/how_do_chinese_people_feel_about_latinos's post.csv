Hey everyone, Im moving to China to teach at a University in Zhengzhou and Ive seen some posts and videos about the way certain foreigners are seen by the Chinese local but I see very little about Latin (or hispanic if you use that lame term) foreigners. Does anybody know what I can expect?. Ps. Its not new to me to be foreign, I had my fair share of challenges living in the South of the US for 6 years."

China,IamAMelodyy,t2_lw9kxl6b,t3_1ds5hoh,,06/30/24 12:34,0,1,0.54,23,"""How do Chinese people outside of China import things from China?. Chinese translation below . I know about Taobao  and Pinduoduo and I speak Chinese fluently and I’m actually half Chinese half German (country of interest is Germany here). But I have yet to figure this out. It seems if you are in some Chinese circle, you can order things in bunches and get for example anything you want from China. And a huge shipping will come for you and all of your friends in your city for example once every three months. Somehow Chinese people can import things cheaply and they do it in groups. I’m not sure how, though. . I know that from within China, it’s possible through Pin duoduo but I want to find out more. . Is Taobao international the only way to buy things from China? I don’t think so. How to they do it?. . "

I saw your Chinese is pretty solid so it wont be a problem. Basically you buy things in China, send them to a designated place, a company will collect and repack, then ship them by either train or air freight, depends on how much you want to pay, of course. I bet in major cities like Frankfurt, there are a lot of these wechat groups."""

When you search  in Taobao, youll find all kinds of these services. You buy stuff from Taobao, ship them to this  warehouse, they pack them for you into big carton boxes, sea/air ship them to your address. If I remember correctly, sea shipment costs around RMB15 per kg, air shipment around RMB 40 per kg. I never tried this but its very very tempting to do. I do not know how they manage to avoid import tax/VAT (Im in the UK). I also have Chinese friends order  to the UK, actually one of my wifes Chinese friend in UK just gave her a few packs of  and  she said she received from  last week."""

Beyond that I would just use aliexpress or similar sites.  they are literally just international versions of popular chinese sites and have many of the exact same sellers on them.

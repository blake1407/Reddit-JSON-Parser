Exactly as the title says, but in this case i have no friends. Throwaway account cause of obvious reasons. I (20M) and my girlfriend (20f), weve been together for almost a year now and she and i have been super mature about everything and constantly try to improve for eachother no matter what. I am so happy i met her, shes such a sweet girl and I dont really know how i wouldve been without her anyways. Especially since we share the same room due to cost of living crises. This obviously brings up more insecurities as she says but weve both been really kind to eachother, at least she has been really and this has allowed us to grow and develop more. . There is one issue though, I am an international student in this country and Ive been here for over an year and i have managed to make 0 friends. Absolutely zero. My girlfriend and I met online so we hit off before even moving together, she has plenty of irl friends who are born in this country back in her hometown and ive interacted them (just follows for now) through Instagram. I want to give my girlfriend a better social circle too, but obviously not just for her for myself as well but i really cant seem to socialise. Especially with dudes/guys, my build is tooo lean and I really cant afford to bulk right now and that gives me another layer of insecurity. Ive been working on this, seeked therapy (especially since my dad was abusive regarding to my body) etc for as long as i can remember but i just cant seem to shake this away. I just cant befriend national born people here and then there are many korean and chinese people too but then its always a communication issue since they might not know english that well and I certainly dont know their languages. I feel like i didnt emphasis enough on just how much my build effects. My wrists are half the size of my girlfriends, theyve just not grown since i was like 4? im in 20s now, a second year university student and this is the case. Theres obviously more to this than just my leanness tho but I wont get much into that as it would be just me with a body dysmorphia rant.  I have no clue what to do about this. I always take her out alone, i have no friends calling me or texting me ever. We go to places and see a group of friends, couples with friends etc and thats just not a life i can provide. As stated my girlfriend is a blessing and she hasnt particularly raised any such questions regarding why but I dont know, i feel like crying. Ive seeked therapy, I obviously have social anxiety, even though its so weird since i have zero issues talking on a phone call, or giving a speech/debate at my university, i never had stage frightening even as a kid but Ive just completely lost it in terms of making any friends.  Ill try my best to answer every and any questions/advice you guys have. "

But im mostly not that interested in it thankfully, maybe you could try working on accepting that having friends is not very easy to reach and try to just do solitary stuff?"""

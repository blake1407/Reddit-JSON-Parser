I apologize if this is too long or not appropriate for this forum. Im a Chinese, 2nd generation immigrant woman in my 20s and I recently learned that I have ADHD combined type. Even when I read my report hundreds of times, call the neuropsych that diagnosed me for confirmations or explanations, and read stories that relate to my own, I still can scarcely believe it. It has brought me a lot of comfort that Im not dumb, slow, or forgetful without a reason, but it also has brought me a lot of sadness. My mother and I dont have a nice relationship. When we meet very briefly or when I stay over for breaks, my mom is very nice to me, but when I stay for too long, she starts being super abrasive. Shes addicted to QAnon conspiracy theories (ironic, considering the rhetoric is hateful towards Chinese people) and has a serious hoarding problem at home. You cannot see the floor of the majority of the house because most of it has boxes of clothes that she impulsively buys. My childhood bed is covered in boxes and the guest bedroom is half covered with clothes that she never wears. In my childhood, she screamed at me to stop fidgeting and has even resorted to physically holding me down. Being ladylike was something she valued a lot and she has iterated many times in my life that she used to be like me until her mother made her the woman she is today. It makes me sad. Recently finding out that we both have ADHD has made me more melancholic than anything because she not only suffered a lot for being not only an Asian woman from a poor background but also with ADHD and she never knew why. I have been considering informing my parents that my sister (who was diagnosed with ADHD before me) and I have ADHD not only because I want to be honest with them, but I think the information would genuinely help them. Is that okay? I want nothing but the best for my mother, even if we dont have the best relationship. Has anyone had this situation before and did it ever turn out okay?"

I genuinely hope that it goes well for you. I also grew up gifted and was the eldest daughter among my siblings. It wasn  a shock my sister got the diagnosis, but finding out that I was also ADHD has been extremely confusing for me. I guess being raised in a ""tiger style"" household really hid the symptoms. I don  usually expect people to take kindly to the idea of being ND, but Im sure that regardless you and your mother will be all the better with this knowledge equipped!"""
adhdwomen,OneMoreDog,t28odnjjsu,t1laaksb0,t1laakcpn,06/25/24 20:55,3,2,0,1,"""This is such a difficult thing to navigate! I don  think you can do the wrong thing by taking a few breaths (ie, time) to get the narrative in your head sorted first and then work out your plan. I have to tell my mum soon. I was the good kid. First born. Rule abiding daughter. ""Smart but does not apply herself"". There is a 90% chance my mum will take it just fine. But also.  she is almost certainly ND herself and I know this would be a big thing for her to process, too. (Spoiler, so are my sibs!)"""
adhdwomen,peach-tadpole,t2aphlp516,t1laakcpn,t1laaelpx,06/25/24 20:40,2,1,0,1,"""Thank you for the feedback!. I apologize for the vagueness. I should have provided the context. My sister has been urging me to tell my mother, not necessarily because I have ADHD but further evidence that proves her ADHD since its apparently genetic. She has already told my father to corroborate her diagnosis and is insisting that I should be the one to make the steps to inform my mother. I dont blame my sister for this at all because she shares the same sentiments as me, but I cant help but also think this could go very very wrong. However, in this case with my mother I had reservations because between the both of us, I have the worst relationship with her. My mother has often informed me that she favors my sister and though I think I have less to lose than my sister, I do wish to maintain my relationship with my mother. You have a point though. If she wants to prove to our mother about her diagnosis, that should be her responsibility and leave the decision of my own alone. My mother has already blamed me for a lot of her feelings and struggles and it has taken a lot of time between our separation for me to detach myself from it, so I wouldnt mind if she continued to direct negative feelings about it towards me, but I just dont want to lose contact with her because of my diagnosis or lose her to the shared struggles that we have just because I didnt tell or help her. But yes, I also entirely agree. I think Ill look a little more into how to help myself first and take the steps to help her without informing her of my diagnosis, at least for now. I think it would be better for all of us."""
adhdwomen,OneMoreDog,t28odnjjsu,t1laaelpx,t31dojx9c,06/25/24 20:02,1,8,0,1,"""A few thoughts. 1. I wouldn  share your sisters diagnosis alone - you do it together or not at all. That isn  your medical info to share and even if your sister says its OK, its her journey to go on with her parent. 2. This could go very poorly. It seems you have more to loose if your mum then projects her own feelings onto you. Do you have the skills to separate her potential negative feelings from what youre responsible for? Do you have a good psych who can talk you through ways to communicate this?. 3. Your mum might also have ND traits that she can /won /doesn  know how to get support with. Hoarding is a symptom of something out of step with social norms. Again, you need to be prepared to separate any projection of feelings she has for what youre actually responsible for. 4. Consider sitting with your own knowledge for a while. Embed the strategies that can support you into your life and get comfortable with this knowledge of yourself. Telling your mum now v telling her in 12 weeks isn  a huge stretch, and you might be in a far better place to let her know ""I have ADHD and this is what Ive found super helpful to manage it."""
adhdwomen,peach-tadpole,t2aphlp516,t1lacqp0m,t1labe0ej,06/26/24 08:27,0,2,0,0,"""Youre right. I was a little optimistic at the prospect of getting closer, that maybe everything would be better if I had been honest with her. Looking back on my conversations with her, Ive found a lot of things that should have been concerning. Ive forgotten most of them, but apparently my sister had been present within some of them and informed me of the things I forgot, like my mother encouraging me to meet other men better than my current partner and driving me away from friends with racist rhetoric and then blaming me for not making the active steps to make friends. When I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and depression, she comforted my sister at my own therapy session. I forgot about that until my sister brought it up, and I think that having my reservations in the first place was a very good thing. I dont hold my sister to any sort of resentment; were close ever since we left the house for our respective universities, so Im thankful that she recognized these incidents and reminded me. I dont see telling my mother would bring us any peace. Im so sorry to hear about your relationship with your mother, but Im glad that youre independent from her expectations. Thank you for sharing your perspective, it means a lot to me"""

Im very close with my father, but hes woefully scientific to a fault. We both love talking about the same things, but hes not entirely convinced about my asexuality or diagnoses, although he does his best to learn. Hes supportive of my sister as well regarding her bisexuality and has been pretty good at keeping this information from our mother, but ADHD is entirely new to him and he thinks that its something wed get institutionalized over lol. Since hes more willing to learn, I didnt think it was an issue to let him know. He always takes new things in stride and once I have more time, Ill have the one on one with him going over my report and resources recommended by the neuropsych."""
adhdwomen,Trackerbait,t22gl1z99h,t1labg9vg,t31dojx9c,06/26/24 00:30,1,2,0,1,"""off topic, but if you haven  watched ""Turning Red"" I strongly recommend it.  The movie has a lot to say about generational trauma and hypervigilant Chinese moms, but in a cute Disney way that actually makes it fun. Think before you tell your mom anything like this, because once you say it, it can  be unsaid.  Id maybe try to repair your relationship with her a bit before you ""come out"" with something this sensitive.  Talk to your sis and support each other in the meanwhile.  And if your dad is in the picture, maybe consider how he could be of use in this situation - you don  want your parents keeping secrets from each other, but it might be easier to tell him first, depending."""

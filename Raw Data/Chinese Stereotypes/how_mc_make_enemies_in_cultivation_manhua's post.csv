Ive been a fan of manhua cultivation for a long time but theres one question that keeps me up at night and I really want to know the answer. This is my question: why in almost every manhua cultivation, the MC makes enemies for the most ridiculous reasons ever. Like this is how MC usually makes enemies:. • The famous retarded “Young Master of X family” the MC is talking to a hot girl, some retarded young master goes completely nuts and tries to kill MC several times for no reason before the young master dies horribly. • Another famous one is “you killed my brother/nephew/son/grandson” I mean I understand this in a way, and I would have avenged my brother too, but if my brother was a criminal piece of shit and died for what he did, that is understandable, but no, those bastards would rather kill their entire clan trying to get revenge for a piece of shit after doing all kinds of bullshits. With their heinous behavior , if MC didn  kill them someone would have killed them sooner. • Another famous one is ""I’m the most brilliant and genius student in the academy"" and then MC comes and starts breaking some records or gaining attention which somehow upsets the top student and he tries to kill the MC several times in the academy/tournament and then gets killed. Ive been following manhwa cultivation for years but I always feel like theyve ran out of ""reasons to make MC hatable by side characters"". Another question I also need to answer is: Did the Chinese actually behave this way before modern society or is it just a blueprint that all authors follow. Im sorry for the Chinese people but somehow it seems that most Chinese people have this toxic attitude in most of their works be it movies or manhua."

""This person looks poor, lets bully them to death"". 2. ""This person looks poor, no way they could afford x, lets call the police and publicly expose them!"". 3. Basically ""this person looks poor"" followed by everything short of genocide as revenge for mc being poor. Like.  what? This person is poor =they should die. Ridiculous."""

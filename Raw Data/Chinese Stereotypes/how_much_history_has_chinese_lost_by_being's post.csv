The other being Egyptian and Mayan and both those are extinct. When you speak to Chinese people, they are very proud of the fact that prior to simplification by the CCP, Chinese writing actually changed very little for 2000 years. . But Chinese spoken language has changed enormously. For speakers of other languages, English for example, they can track the changes in their spoken language over the millenia. Modern English is different to Shakespeare which is different to Chaucer, for the same word. Chinese doesnt have that. Yes Classical Chinese uses different characters but we dont actually know what they sounded like two thousand years ago. We only know what they sound like in the pronunciation of modern Chinese. So much linguistic history is lost from the non-phonetic nature of Chinese characters. Its great for literary history and I can why Chinese scholars love them. But in terms of tracking linguistic history and even when tracking the history of dialects so much is lost. . What did the Classical Chinese version of Yue & Wu sound like? Nobody knows. How and when did the 7 major dialect groups split off from each other? Not a clue. . We know exactly when Spanish and Portuguese split from each other in the European languages coz their writing and spelling changed to reflect that they no longer saw themselves as being the same peoples. I just wish more of the history of Chinese languages was actually recorded and that Chinese people would actually be interested in this, but they are not. They would rather believe the lie that their language has stayed the same for millenia because the characters themselves havent changed that much. . Some Chinese households have surnames that are older than the history of entire nations and kingdoms in the West, this makes them very proud and very unwilling to actually investigate this history. Its such a weird phenomenon."

By that time, people realized that Chinese language changed over time already and recorded the sounds.  Although not perfect, but in year 600, thats older than old English or most modern Latin languages. . As for Chinese family names, we live our own lives, not for our ancestors. It really doesnt matter if your ancestors used to be nobilities etc. In a funny way, the Chinese idea of the mandate of heaven paved the way for violent revolutions and rebellions, so there were dynasties established by peasants. It doesnt really matter who your ancestors are. People with wang  family name (Zhou Dynasty nobility) certainly have no privilege than any others. Who cares if your ancestors were a noble in the year 800BCE."""

And yes, the nature of the script does not record that aspect of speech. But in terms of “history” per se, I would say written classical Chinese represents the largest corpus of historical documents. Outside of very specific niche interests, the linguistic/phonetic history is not that important. For a non-linguist, it is much more useful to understand the meaning of the word without knowing how it was historically pronounced, than knowing how to accurately pronounce a word but not knowing the meaning"""

Im pretty sure there are people who research this.

Firstly, the Chinese varieties have been diverging for a long time providing a significant amount of evidence to reconstruct earlier pronunciations. Most of the varieties diverged from Middle Chinese for which we also have rime tables describing character pronunciations. Hence, our understanding of Middle Chinese pronunciation is really good. Some varieties, in particular Min Chinese, see, to have diverged much earlier, providing phonetic data to approximate even older forms. Another comment linked to NativLang’s video on Ancient Chinese pronunciation, which explains this well. Secondly, much of Old Chinese writing was rhymed. This is useful for reconstructing the characters’ finals, particularly as once rhyming characters can differ wildly in their modern pronunciations. For example, Baxter and Sagart discuss the rhyming of  yǒu and  cǎi in Ode 8 of the Shijing, which do not rhyme even in Middle Chinese. They thus reconstruct rhyming forms ɢwəʔ and s.r̥ˁəʔ. Thirdly, most Chinese characters were formed by modifying existing Chinese characters based on pronunciation. To make a new character, you would start with an existing character with a similar pronunciation, and add a radical component to specify the change in meaning. This can be easily seen in the characters ,  and , where the second two gain their pronunciation from  and have the radicals  and  to specify the meaning. It is generally assumed that the initials in related characters differ only in voicing (k vs g, t vs d). However there exist confounding pairs like  rú and  shù where the initial is different. These forms are reconstructed by Baxter and Sagart as na and n̥а-s, where the initials are very similar in Old Chinese. Finally, more recent studies have started comparing Chinese pronunciations with equivalent pronunciations in non-Sinitic languages, where the words were borrowed in the Old Chinese period and often retain remnants of the older pronunciation. For example, Baxter and Sagart justify reconstructing  zhǐ as k.teʔ based on languages which have/had an initial k/g. Compare Vietnamese giấy and Rục kəcáy. Although reconstructing Old Chinese pronunciations is a beastly task, there is certainly a tonne of evidence available to approximate what it could have sounded like. . On a final note, you wrongly assume that we have a complete understanding of Egyptian because their writing was phonetic, but the reality is much messier: we don’t know how many of the consonants were actually pronounced and vowels are generally omitted. While the phonetic values of hieroglyphs provides very useful information, reconstructions of Old/Middle/Late Egyptian still use the same techniques as reconstructions of Old Chinese — modern pronunciations (from Coptic), borrowed words, related words in the Semitic languages and so on. Equivalently, the grammar of Old Egyptian is understood much less than the grammar of Old Chinese due to the lack of written vowels, which we know changed based on grammar."""

The power of Classical Chinese is not because it a logographic writing. Classical Chinese and Classical Chinese texts are essential to all East Asian societies, just as Ancient Greek and Latin texts are essential to all European societies. Well educated Europeans can read and understand Latin and Greek, not because they speak it as a native language, but because these ancient texts are the foundations of their societies regardless of the actual language that they speak. The Confucian analects can be read by Chinese people, sure, but they are also read and studied by Japanese people, by Koreans, by the Vietnamese before the French takeover. This has nothing to do with Chinese writing being better, it is that Classical Chinese learning forms the basis of all these societies. You cannot compare Classical Chinese to English because they do not have the same standing. What you can do, is to compare English to Vietnamese. Both are regional languages with much shorter histories than Chinese or Greek or Latin.

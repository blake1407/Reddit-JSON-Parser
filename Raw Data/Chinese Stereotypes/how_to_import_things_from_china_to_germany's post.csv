Chinese translation below (this was flagged in the China subreddit but I’m Shanghainese to I uhhh thought I’d just post it here and hope for the best lol). I know about Taobao  and Pinduoduo and I speak Chinese fluently and I’m actually half Chinese half German (country of interest is Germany here). But I have yet to figure this out. It seems if you are in some Chinese circle, you can order things in bunches and get for example anything you want from China. And a huge shipping will come for you and all of your friends in your city for example once every three months. Somehow Chinese people can import things cheaply and they do it in groups. I’m not sure how, though. . I know that from within China, it’s possible through Pin duoduo but I want to find out more. . Is Taobao international the only way to buy things from China? I don’t think so. How to they do it?. . "

Just find a shipping forwarder and they can accept your packages and then gather them, repack and send them to Germany, the price is not too cheap, but includes tax. I can tell you about the experience with this specific forwarder once the shipping arrives in Germany at my parents house."""

Google ""forwarder"" or ""private forwarder"" or whatever it is in German. There are also websites that send food globally, Im Dutch and we got:  they send it righ to you in China. Typically you receive a notice a package has arrived and you need to come in and pay taxes. Whatever gets send to China ensure it has a clear packing bill with whats inside and the value. China doesn  charge much but its a real pain to fill in all the details. Done that countless times and everything came through except during Covid. . (Alternatively you can also get your family to simply send you a box, again make sure you got a clear packing bill). Clothes can be tricky if you send new I imagine they want to tax it properly. . Further packages send to China in excess of 1.000 RMB value, the product itself not including delivery is seen as business. Ive had once a package of food in excess of 1.000 rmb come my way and its impossible to get it cleared at that point, they will ask sorts of documentation which can  be done."""

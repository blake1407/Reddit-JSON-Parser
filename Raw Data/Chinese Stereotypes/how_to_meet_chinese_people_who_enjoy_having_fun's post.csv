Let me first prefix this by saying that my Mandarin Chinese is pretty good. So, while the language barrier might be a tiny issue, and it definitely is an issue on occasion, I don  think its the main issue. It feels like many Chinese people simply don  like talking. For example, many Chinese young people will happily just sit next to each other for maybe hours while barely saying a single word - just playing on their phone while smoking a cigarette or something. I somehow often find myself carrying conversations in Chinese with Chinese people a lot of the time. And to the extent Chinese people do talk, it seems like they don  really ""banter"" or joke around that much in the same many people from the USA, the UK, etc. do.  In basically any group of 4+ foreigners from the US/UK, a ""fun"" conversation will result.  This is very rarely the case for Chinese people, in my experience. How would I go about having fun conversations with young Chinese people? I am perfectly cablable of telling jokes in Chinese and making them laugh, but theres no give and take - its just a one way conversation with me trying to create a fun environment, and then eventually just giving up because Im the only one making jokes. This in contrast to when I am with a group of foreigners, where I can say something - not even necessarily something funny - but over time it can turn into something funny or interesting because of how conversations with foreigners are more likely to work."

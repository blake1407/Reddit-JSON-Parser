Unfortunately Reddit does not show them as Live Photos but you can look up their IDs on XHS and can find these posts. Chinese makeup, also known as Douyin makeup has been extremely popular for a few years now. Unfortunately, because not everyone has a XHS account nor the language proficiency to understand Mandarin, a lot of tutorials and tips have not been absorbed into western media. . A lot of non-Chinese folk have taken content from Chinese content creators without knowledge and the context, which is why I’m here today to fill in the gap after seeing someone asking how to perfect Chinese makeup. . U0001fa75U0001fa75U0001fa75U0001fa75U0001fa75U0001fa75U0001fa75U0001fa75U0001fa75U0001fa75U0001fa75U0001fa75U0001fa75U0001fa75. Here are some concise tips if you’d like to emulate the general Chinese makeup look (the basis of all Chinese makeup styles):. Tldr:. - Clean, but natural looking full brows. - Clustered manhua lashes. - Soft matte base (with no glittery highlight on the cheekbones) . - Powder highlight especially on the mid face and chin . - Glittery highlight on the inner corners of the eyes, smile bag, nose tip, philtrum. - Emphasise on smile bags . - Eyeliner is usually felt tip/gel pencil in brown, brown black or black. - Lip glazes or lip muds (most popular shades are apricot or red bean). - Circle lenses!!. EYEBROWS: . The shape of your eyebrows is dependent on your facial bone structure and features. Hence, there isn’t a set eyebrow shape like there is in Korean makeup where they prefer very straight eyebrows. Chinese people tend to like soft arched or curved eyebrows though, as it compliments a lot of their face shapes. . They like clean looking eyebrows, but with a hairlike/natural flair. Therefore, a lot of them fill in their eyebrows using sharp strokes. EYELASHES:. They use “manhua” lashes - sometimes they’re a full set, clustered, or individual. The most popular are cluster lashes as it adheres to the shape of your eyes best. Also, they have different styles for different eye shapes or looks (e.g. foxy, dolly). 3-4 clusters is enough for an eye. . Lower eyelashes are either drawn on with an ultra fine eyeliner pen or with individual lashes. . BASE:. They like the soft matte look. The most popular foundations in China are from western brands. There are also popular Chinese foundations though, such as Judydoll’s cushion foundation. The highlight and contouring part is what makes Chinese makeup extremely unique. They base their technique on actual art techniques and focus a lot on creating proper dimension instead of just randomly shading their faces. I’ve extracted a photo from the app that illustrates this, though I think a video tutorial would be even better. . One of the tricks here is to use powder highlight instead of layering concealer like how it’s done in the west. This highlight contour thing is also what differentiates Chinese makeup with Japanese or Korean makeup where they usually have a flat base with very minimal contouring. The “C” shape nose contour, mid face/inner cheek + nasolabial highlight is very important if you want to emulate this look as with most Chinese makeup looks this is present. LIPS. Most Chinese people love lip glazes which are slightly different from lip glosses. Their favorite colors are apricot and red bean shades. There are a lot of lip contouring techniques available already. Lip muds are also incredibly popular. . EYES. There are so many types of eye looks it’s hard to make a concise list. But plenty of Chinese makeup use the following:. - C shape inner highlight. - The eyelashes as indicated above. - Circle lenses (VERY IMPORTANT!!). - If you want a natural look, it’s important to incorporate flesh toned pinks, apricots, browns, and natural highlight shades. - Emphasise on the smile bags . Honestly, the biggest takeaway is the circle lenses! It seals the makeup look. . I’ve also uploaded some pictures of popular products to further illustrate everything I’ve said. . It’s incredibly hard to explain and fit Chinese makeup in 1 post because of the immensity of styles and tips offered by them. They are extremely focused on “enhancing your features” instead of having a strict style that everyone must adhere to regardless of their differences. So they have tips for olive skinned toned people, wide faced, long faced, flat head, large nose, small nose, small lips, etc. like e v e r y t h i n g. . If you’d like more in depth explanation you can check out Dear Peachie on YouTube, it’s an account that extracts tips and tricks from these Chinese content creators and translates them into English. From hair, makeup, bone structure, everything beauty related. U0001fa75U0001fa75U0001fa75U0001fa75U0001fa75U0001fa75U0001fa75U0001fa75U0001fa75U0001fa75U0001fa75U0001fa75U0001fa75U0001fa75. There’s also this notion that Chinese makeup only looks good in photography, but that’s also not the case. The problem is that people look at all the different styles of Chinese makeup and use the umbrella term: Douyin makeup. Chinese people themselves have many different terms for the different styles of their makeup. Even with these few images alone you can tell there are different styles. All Chinese makeup is suitable for real life besides that very one style/technique that’s meant for photography. To say it looks bad irl just means the person who did the makeup didn’t get the techniques right. It’s not supposed to look bad irl."

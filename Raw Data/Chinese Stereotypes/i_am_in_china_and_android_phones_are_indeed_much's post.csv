There are Xiaomi, Vivo, and Oppo phone factories near my home that produce phones for people all over the world. The government subsidizes phone production, so the prices of phones in China are much lower than in other countries. I want to sell Chinese phones elsewhere. Could you please tell me how to find buyers or become my partner? Please dont suggest selling the phones on platforms like Amazon, eBay, or AliExpress, as these platforms restrict Chinese people from selling phones on them. "

Why would anyone want these phones if you can’t sell them through the most popular sales channels? You’d have to sell them on the grey market where there is next to zero demand for these phones. The US does have super cheap Android phones as well, you just never heard of them."""

In Europe, that’s 21% for electronic goods. Then you’ll need to pay for shipping costs, which will reduce your profit margin, probably leaving you with less than 100 euros per phone (just a rough estimate)."""

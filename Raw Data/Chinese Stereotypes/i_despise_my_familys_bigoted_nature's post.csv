So, me and my family are south asian. Insert every incel, auntie and curry stereotype. So one of my relatives is engaged with someone East Asian, which not only pissed off her dad(my uncle) but also my dad. When my uncle found out, he was pissed and pretended to be depressed to my dad. They called them(couple) animals and blamed western society. My dad said in Bangla ""Oh I came here in this country and worked everyday only for our kids to not listen to their parents. Bangladesh was so more peaceful of a life and the young generation is so much smarter  and respects their parents there"" really showcasing his bigoted and overdramatic attitude. This is also not the first time as another relative married a white person and it got the same reactions within the family until that person converted to Islam(my famly is very cherry-picking when it comes religion). They hate this because this scenario happened a second time, and this was with a east asian(they think all east asians are Chinese and they have this racist ideology that all Chinese people carry covid). I hate the attitudes against marrying and having relationships outside of ethnicity. I also hate that they pervert relationships as a transaction and baby-making process. Many of the people in my family that are older like my dad, uncles and aunts arranged married and its usually between a man that is 7-15 years older than the woman. My own mother(who is a literal decade younger) supports this as she views relationships where the woman is older or both parties are the same age as not ideal as she thinks the younger the bride is, the more likely she will abide the husbands wishes(internalized misogyny is a drug). My dad is also a creep as when he was younger, he worked in airport security and admitted to looking at womens cleavage(he said this at a house party complaining about what American girls wear). The men tend to be raised very misogynistically and have this belief system that women should be the one that raises the kids while doing all the housework while the man does all the financials(and also they view not having kids or adopting as a big no no). This is where my problems start as my parents already seen this ""abomination"" known as interracial marriage twice, so I fear that they are going to monitor me a lot more than usual. I don  have a significant other(depressed wreck atm, not a good time nor condition for me to ask people out), but theyre most likely going to do the arranged marriage talks with me after I graduate(which is why I really gotta move out then). I actually got a story regarding this. So I got accepted to a university upstate but my parents forbade it for two reasons, one was my mom suffered from heavy arthritis so I was forced to be her nurse and room service since she couldn  walk or hold shit very well. The other reason was theyd fear that I would date, have premarital sex and drink if I dormed upstate(mind you, Im very introverted but my parents don  even know me as a person but as a caricature). So they placed me to a college near my house instead(funny enough, my parents bitch about how I didn  get into a gucci university even though I did, you just forced me to not enroll). Anyways, I hope the relative that is engaged and her fiancé are well and their wedding isn  booed on by my family(shes legitimately not happy which I feel bad for). If I had the ability to send my father and her dad to a retirement home, Id do it.  Really despise my family and this bigoted, misogynistic, racist and narcissistic mentality are the reasons. Even some of the people my age(Im 21) in my family have these attitudes cause they were raised like this. I have a 20 year old cousin(same cousin my dad bribed college admissions for which I mentioned in one of my posts before), whose most likely going to be a wife-beater because he is a disgusting and sexist fuck(he wants to become a doctor to inspect women like a pervert) but my dad and his parents will kiss his ass. Anyways, just need to get away from them. easier said than done but Im plotting. . . UPDATE: So my dad kinda mellowed out or visibly stopped giving a shit about it. But he did recently make a weird comment saying ""how did we go from Bangladesh to China?"" regarding the marriage. Also, I did find out my cousins fiance(cousin in law?) is actually half chinese, but then again my family did make racist comments. "

Its always extra funny when South Asian muslims pride themselves on being the most pious but then go against the very tenets of their religions. You can pinpoint all the verses which specifically say that Islam is for everyone and that Bilal RA was black. But no they gonna cherry pick like hell because they know better of course. . And the marriage thing I so relate. I had a cousin come over and hear him say that women over 30 get ugly so they need to get married quickly. As a fellow person plotting I wish you luck."""

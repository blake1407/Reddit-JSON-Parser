I’m traveling in Japan and have run into a few Chinese people who ask if I speak Chinese, to which I respond, “Yes I speak Cantonese”. But then they look at me with a confused face, and sometimes even say, “I don’t know what that is.” If I have it in me, I will try to clarify by saying , “I don’t speak Mandarin, I speak Cantonese” to no effect.

I cant read those Chinese characters and I do not feel Google Translate or any other online translation software would do them justice as the translations from said softwares will interpret it literally rather than contextually. I would tend to agree with your thoughts and opinions above. . Throughout human history, wouldnt you tend to agree that those in power generally try to erase the bits of history that the particular individual in power does not want to continue to exist? I wouldnt say its normal or acceptable, necessarily, but its common. Whether its American history, Canadian history, or European history, those in power want to change the narrative--effectively changing history along with it and in a manner of speaking, brainwashing the new generation to carry on that new history as if its the golden standard--like its always been that way. . That just happens to be what China is doing right now. But this characteristic is not unique to China. Every country around the world goes through this cycle. The Americans have been doing this for the better part of over 6 centuries since the proto-Americans landed on the shores of the Americas and wiped out the existing inhabitants thats already been here for at least two millenia."""

I share my thoughts with my own experiences (mostly from research and interacting with , since I was born in South East Asia, but just share my two cents since you requested. . I think the “dialect” is a political way to promote Mandarin in the land of Cantonese . But it does not simply end there, cause it implicitly causes a language/culture slowly dies out (the current situation in , I guess? Never been there). . There are worse ways to refer to Cantonese like “” which kinda implies Cantonese (and maybe other Chinese languages) is something like Barbarians’ language??? . As someone who is proud of being a Cantonese and how prosperous in terms of culture and finance of / are, I am furious. Preserve language means preserve culture."""

Cantonese is apparently not a proper language because it is too similar to mandarin because of waves and waves immigration of northerners to Guangdong who brought their civilization and language to that place in history. Cantonese is too similar to mandarin to develop its own genuinely independent writing system. Most young Cantonese students are accepting mandarin education, whether it is in Guangdong province or Malaysia, which becomes a trend even in Hong Kong. Cantonese is dying, which makes the habit of sticking to it silly."""

My mom is always telling me to go out and socialize. Okay, fair. It’s not just her being worried about me finding a Chinese husband, she also wants me to have more Chinese friends my age. Again, fair. The problem is we never see eye to eye. I told her the best way to meet people is sports. I met some nice older sister figures while doing sports. She’s like, “Stop doing sports, you’re ruining your skin.” Context: I usually have flawless skin, but I got stressed with work so I recently got very small tiny colorless bumps on my forehead. She told me I need to wait months for the bumps to go away or else I’ll repel any potential new friends or men. . At the same time, she’ll tell me to join dance studios with older moms and aunties so I get to know more people. But I also can’t do it just yet, since my skin isn’t perfect yet. Now, she wants me to join those China / Taiwan tour things to meet more people. I told her that 1) I’m not willing to use up all my office leaves for that and 2) If she’s hoping for me to meet the love of my life there, it’s like 90% girls and 10% dudes. She told me she wants me to meet more Chinese people my age, period. However the places I met the most people are when I did sports and stuff but she doesn’t want me to do it because 1) it’s dangerous (for example, climbing) and 2) it’s bad for the skin and 3) I need to clear my skin first lest I scare away people. . I am also ready for her to scold me when she realizes I made non-Chinese friends. I remember I went to a Chinese church coz she forced and she got so mad when I had a new friend group that was all homeschooled Chinese girls (note: mom is the Protestant, I’m Catholic and everyone there secretly hated Catholics lol). And when I do a new sport she’ll scold me if my new friends are not Chinese BECAUSE wow we live in a Southeast Asian country, ofc there aren’t enough Chinese people. . So how tf will I meet more people if she’s like this? "

""NO Chinese friends to brag about, what will MY friends say???. how embarrassing!!!""."""
AsianParentStories,user87666666,t2lhqqckzh,t1ldoabzx,t1ldlqrox,07/17/24 17:19,0,2,0,0,"""Yup. I made Chinese friends in the West- AM ""Why so many Chinese people in the West? You go Thailand and its the opposite. So many white people"". I have international friends, AM will say ""Why dont you make friends from people from your native asian country? Your friends from all over the world, so you dont know your own culture"". By the way, I took a diversity and mental health class, and the professor said I am A+ student and have deep insights to every culture"""

My dad is constantly ranting about how my brother and I don’t go out and socialize anymore but we work from home and are focusing on our careers at the moment so you have to make time and effort to socialize. They now seem to think we should get married and start a family to cope for the loneliness. and that’s also why they want us to socialize more now so that we can find a partner. They pretty much always have an agenda and never appreciate anything. It’s best not to take advice from people who don’t set a good example anyways."""

Theyre never happy. Id rather be at least doing what I want while theyre bitching rather than be unhappy while theyre bitching. And who cares about your skin!? Like people with ""bad"" skin have never met other people before? Ridiculous logic."""

In fact, use it to weed out shitty shallow people (like your mom lol) . Trust me, you can do everything she tells you to do and shell still find something to nitpick and complain about. So you have two choices: . Do everything she wants and make yourself miserable only to be nagged and criticized. . Or live your life the way you want and be nagged and criticized."""

Even if you find Chinese friends, she will complain about their job, earning potential, family, etc If you continue listening to her every snarky remark, you will feel like giving up and will be worse with her complaining about how you are just wasting away your life sitting at home not doing anything. Continue doing the things you want to do like engaging in sports and other hobbies of your choice while making new friends regardless of ethnicity. Its your life NOT hers. If you want to work on those skin bumps and stress management, do it for yourself not to appease your moms demands. Years ago when I was looking for a good place to volunteer at, my future FIL bluntly told my parents if they keep nitpicking about the reputable places Im scoping, I will come out empty handed and discouraged. Let her explore and experience life basically he said. Its a classic case of parents claiming to know whats best for their children when in reality its off the mark."""

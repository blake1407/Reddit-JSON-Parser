For some background: A lot of Chinese people where I live panic if their daughters are still single, though societal mindset has improved a bit. . I was once told that I was too picky and I need to settle. But I don’t think I’m picky at all. I recently met a guy I really liked, everyone who saw him knew he liked me. Even my guy cousin who was best friends with him approved of the relationship. Genuinely thought he could be the one. And then it came out that the guy had a secret long term girlfriend of how many years. I have no qualms about moving on. But the thing is—I don’t think I’m picky, I feel like I’ve rejected guys for very valid reasons. I once rejected a guy for telling a lot of lies, gossiping, and insulting my family—he also called a bunch of girls ugly despite not being good-looking himself. I distanced myself from another guy because he didn’t actually like me, his parents just wanted him to date me. He was very creepy, slow, stubborn, and hard to communicate with because he had high-functioning autism, but all of his other siblings had low-functioning autism and sometimes he acted like his siblings. Another guy I found cute but I didn’t date him because I found out he’s a playboy and has cheated a lot before. So I don’t want to worry—I’m just going to focus on improving myself and putting myself out there to enjoy my twenties while working on my career development. However, a lot of old Chinese aunties are saying I might be too picky because I’m relatively good-looking, wealthy, and accomplished. They kept warning me if I keep acting picky I’ll end up regretting it. Though I have some much older girlfriends who got married recently who reassured me that as I grow older I’ll start to meet the more mature guys willing to settle down and commit. . However, some aunties still keep saying I’m too picky and need to settle for someone soon despite their flaws. But I don’t want to believe that and I believe that I am ending up with a decent guy. Can someone reassure me and tell me I wasn’t being too picky to reject the guy I loved because I found out he had a secret girlfriend? That I wasn’t being too picky when I rejected a lying guy, an autistic guy, and a cheater? Those are valid reasons to reject people right?  . And I don’t think I’m picky if I met guys in the past who I genuinely liked but ultimately were cheaters, or who ended up changing their mind about me because they didn’t want commitment. Sorry. I’m really anxious now. I don’t want to end up with the wrong person so I don’t want to waste my time. I believe I make good decisions. "

They mature, but they rarely change their base nature unless living like they do is hurting them in some way. So if a man has a bunch of red flags, know that marrying him means youre  going to deal with those red flags for the rest of your life. You wont likely find someone perfect; he will have annoying habits. But you dont have to settle for big red flags like dishonesty (cheating, two-faced), meanness, violent, doesnt see you as a whole person, weaponized incompetence, or inability to control himself. I know thats a Western view about life, but it sounds like youre on board with that."""

internetparents,csonnich,t250z8j,t1ld128at,t31e2f07n,07/13/24 15:04,1,5,0,1,"""You don  need anybodys permission or even a ""good"" reason to decide you don  want to be with somebody - the fact that you don  want to be there is enough. In the cases of the guys you rejected, though, Im pretty sure nearly all women would agree with you that those are 100% dealbreakers.xa0. . Being alone is a lot better than being in a situation you don  want to be in. Not sticking it out is much better than wasting your time with the wrong person. Settling just keeps both of you from finding people who are actually right for you (although these guys have a lot of growing to do before thats even possible). Your aunties don  appear to have your best interests in mind, sadly. Theyre parroting what theyve learned from a culture that doesn  prioritize womens well-being.xa0. . Keep trusting yourself. You know whats best for you and whats not. Not cheating on you is really the absolute lowest bar for what you should be asking for in a relationship. You deserve so much more than that.xa0"""

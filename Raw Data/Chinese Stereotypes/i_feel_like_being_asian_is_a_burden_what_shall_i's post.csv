I am hyper-aware and hypervigilant about my behavior in public because I am acutely aware of Sinophobia and the stereotypes against Chinese people. I constantly strive not to contribute to these stereotypes. For example, when eating at a restaurant, I ensure that we sit up straight and use proper table manners. In public, I make a point to walk tall and straight, avoiding any appearance of being timid or shy. I’m careful not to take up too much space, talk too loudly, or appear rude. While these behaviors might seem normal, they stem not from self-esteem but from racial trauma and racial PTSD. My entire experience in public revolves around being hyper-aware of how others perceive me as Chinese, and I act in ways to counteract the “rude Chinese” stereotype. This constant vigilance is exhausting. I wish I wasnt so hyper-aware, but I know that one “bad” behavior on my part could easily reinforce negative stereotypes about the entire Chinese population. This burden makes every outing feel like a performance to prove that Chinese people are not all rude, submissive, shy, or weak as the stereotypes suggest. Living like this has led to major anxiety, preventing me from existing in the moment. I am constantly on guard, worried about encountering racism. The situation becomes even more stressful when Im with my parents. They are shy, timid, and often walk hunched over, which makes me angry because I feel they are contributing to the stereotype. Both of my parents are socially awkward and anxious, with no understanding of how to navigate Western social norms. Every time they have an encounter with someone, I feel a silent rage at their awkwardness and anxiety. Theyre clueless about the need to adapt to survive in a different social environment, despite my repeated explanations. Going out, especially with my parents, is incredibly stressful and makes me angry. I feel overwhelmed by the need to constantly counteract stereotypes and ensure that we don’t reinforce negative perceptions. . Has anyone else experienced this, and how do you cope with it?"

(i say this bc i did this but for my own culture/experiences). why do you have to hold yourself and your parents to the standards of people wholl never truly accept you anyways? I dont care about white peoples opinions on black hair styles. i dont care what white people think about aave or if they think i sound """"uneducated"""""". Nothing is going to remove the target on my skin, i dont feel like wasting energy trying to find an acceptance im never going to get. . And im sorry youre burdened with this. It sounds painful, and i hope you find peace with this."""

I dont mean to trivialize how debilitating social anxiety can be.  I know it can feel like a seizure of some sort, not able to fully control yourself. I think setting the intention and being open about the path is key. On the journey youll discover your strength, perseverance, and resourcefulness as you push yourself to meet your goal. Youll see what new skills you have to learn and new perspectives to take.  Its a new level of living, daring to take what you want instead of letting others perceptions rule you. Take a leap of faith, even if you wear a rubber suit the first go"""
cptsdbipoc,Bumblebeebops,t2s97yfuqek,t1legndmc,t1lebwf7b,07/22/24 19:30,2,2,0,1,"""Thanks for your comment. That’s true, I have internalised the racism so much. Logically I know that racists are gonna hate no matter what I do. But when I’m physically outside, I literally feel my body tense and go tight and I get hypervigilant. I also have extreme social anxiety. It’s funny that you said I can decide to be free bc that was my goal all my life. To exist freely without being hyper self conscious. I guess I need a whole lotta therapy"""
cptsdbipoc,DamianosX,t25b34427g,t1lebwf7b,t31e8zrrk,07/21/24 23:40,1,14,0,1,"""I stopped doing this. If you do this, then you are confirming within yourself that their racist caricatures are meaningful and legitimate. Youre dehumanizing yourself. Youve allowed their policing tactics to take root in your own psyche, like some insidious form of psychological malware. Be human. Be everything that you are, accept it, express it. The racist ones will never accept you regardless, even if they pretend to. Its like that video Vivek released weeks ago with Anne Coulter, where she aggressed him on his own podcast due to his race even though he caters to everything white conservatives like to see. If Im disappointed, angry, happy, whatever it is, I allow myself to be and express it, within reason. I have sovereignty over my own person, and I feel more whole for it. It takes time to develop the psychological skills to successfully deal with the inevitable attention this kind of self-possession will attract, but it all starts with the decision to be free, and practicing your way to success."""

But the internalised racism has altered my brain so much that I do it automatically. I do it as a trauma response/survival mechanism.

I can tell you what helped me a lot was just noticing how racist white people act & what they say.  Regardless of what you do, they will change the goal posts to suit their image of you as inferior: if you’re not ghetto, you’re uppity; if you’re different from us, you ought to leave…but also, you can’t immigrate here to assimilate either. Once I realized that, I was able to relax, be me, & accept all bipoc as a big extended family that I could draw strength from when I needed. There’s a lot of online resources for what troubles you, here’s one (the section for you starts on page 3)."""

I hope you understand that your family’s distain for China is a little different than what OP is talking about. I think OP is talking about racism from western countries. Taiwanese people have political issues with China, not race issues (esp as most are the same race). I grew up in Taiwan and not a single time in my entire life do I not remember China’s threats and positioning missiles over us. I love my roots and Chinese culture and history, and it has some of the most beautiful landscapes in the world, but politically speaking, I have no love for that. And honestly claims about China trying to influence others opinion through online media, especially regarding Taiwan, are probably not as far off base as you think.

It disheartens me that the moment people hear about anything chinese they look at it with disgust. At the end of the day were still people just like everybody else and this is something I live by when I meet someone different from me. . Unfortunately the media has a large play in how people view chinese people. Something is chinese? Its there as spyware and influencing you towards communism or whatever wild claims people put out there. I love video games and play many games with many cultural backgrounds including games from china. I view these games just like any other games: video games made with passion and love from their developers. My parents don  like that I play chinese video games and say itll brainwash me. Only thing the chinese games have really done to me is make me appreciate pretty men more lol . One of my wishes is for people to learn more about chinese culture and experience it themselves. Taiwan also celebrates lunar new year and its one of the biggest things I look forward to each year. When people learn to appreciate differences, the world will have a little more harmony."""

After 9/11 ALL brown people were attacked. Sikhs were being shot in the face because racists figured ""whats the difference?!"" Theyre not even Muslim! Now its the Jews. Its Hate Du Jour. . I know it sucks. I know it hurts. Don  be ashamed of what you are or your heritage because being Chinese is about centuries of tradition, innovation and honor.

I think a larger emphasis is definitely placed on Japanese/Korean East Asians when it comes to a ""desirable Asian"", but I do agree that Chinese people at large are a target of hate. When you look at these Asian hate crimes and videos, even if the person isn  Chinese, they are often immediately labeled as such, as if its the worst type of Asian you can be. . So many people are blindsided to the fact that every culture has its terrible downsides, and that includes Japan and Korea. Ive never had anything against Chinese culture, however after dating my Chinese boyfriend, Ive been able to learn and experience more cultural things they do or believe in. Its really nice to see that they do a lot of things that Viet culture does (I mean, I know we were once colonized by them and all but still cool!)

Maybe you can try mix those in your feed. Dont let the negativity online affect you, I know its hard to separate.  the best way is probably to reduce your consumption of that content if you can.

I’m a mix of a bunch of Asian ethnicities, including North and South Chinese from my maternal side, and I think I have experienced some of what you’re talking about. But you have to remember that Chinese are the most populous within East and Southeast Asia, and they make many things cheap for poor people. Between Chinese made and Japanese made products, most people would choose Japanese made because of the quality difference. Chinese make cheap products and with shit regulations, have no problem stealing designs from artists and businesses. So I think people started to associate China with cheapness. But people still purchase the most made in China items. And talentless egoists feel the need to put others down to feel superior I think.

Feel free to discuss politely.. I must express some facts I know about this matter. I currently live in Australia. I lived in New Zealand from 2017 to 2022. I am an Asian, Chinese to be precise. My father participated in many blockchain projects in the early days, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. My father is the mayor of a place in China (with a certain influence). He is also mining, but my father is not well educated. I can say that most of the people who participate in pi in China are uneducated poor people, many of whom are elderly and heavily in debt. Many Chinese conferences and activities on the Internet are fake. I have participated in several times in China. There are some idiots who are daydreaming that the price of a pi coin gcv is 2 million dollars. They have to pay about 100 dollars to attend this meeting. The people who organize the meeting will sell clothing and hats about pi, and of course this bunch of idiots. The children participated in the meeting with money. They ate, drank, and daydreamed together. People seemed to enjoy this process. My uncle studied for a PhD in IT in the U.S. (Camtell University). He graduated from it. He once went to Stanford to investigate this project for me. No one cared and no one heard of it. The educated people in my family didnt care about this project. It was different from the early participants in Bitcoin. The early participants in Bitcoin and blockchain were all elites in the computer field. You can see that they were all poor people in Africa or India, Vietnam, and the Philippines. They hoped that Pi coins would make them millionaires. In Europe and the United States, basically no one dug up this garbage. In fact, I heard some rumors in China because the police at my house arrested many pyramid schemes, MLM, fund-raising, and fraudsters. Guess what they were doing after they were released from prison? Promote pi coin, become an organizer, including the Chinese community has a lot of traffic through pi, sell their own garbage, if you have been paying attention, you should have found that I posted a post on this forum that I will go to Korea and Japan to explore pi. I had information at first, but in fact I did not find the pioneers in Korea. I tried to contact those Korean bloggers on youtube, including Korean map software apps or websites. I sent them private messages and emails, but no one responded, and I observed The so-called stores that support Pi payment shown on the Korean Pi map are all in far suburbs. The most important and crucial thing is that the first person who talked about Pi coin in China had a rumor that Pi was made by Chinese people. This is why he is so crazy in China, but like garbage in the United States. The Chinese man is called Zhang Peng, a fraudster from Shenzhen, China, and later went to the United States. He had worked in MLM and pyramid schemes before. Then he went to the United States and won over a couple to make this kind of garbage to trick people into paying them advertising fees. By observing the videos released by the Pi producer, we can hear that he cant even speak English fluently. What I mean is that he doesnt look like an American, but like an Indian or a wanderer. You can refute me, but I will go to South Korea and Japan, and finally return to my motherland. Dreaming is beautiful, enjoy it"

Just wait for it and be patient, its not like you can do anything about it nor doing anything to develop it. leave pi if you cant wait. Scam or not you dont really lose anything but some of your data, which most people already have scattered around in the internet. Ive been mining since 2019 on and off and I dont really care if pi takes off or not. like I said its nice if it works but if it doesnt its no biggie. you cant expect pi to be more than a dollar since so many people have pi especially from third world countries who are thinking this is gonna be their ticket to richness. i bet theyd sell off the moment mainnet becomes active."""

The books is interesting. Is telling a lot hypothesis about Old One (Outer God), is also telling that Original Creator strunggle to tame Extraordinary Characteristic, actually he also hope Intellegent Life (Especially Human) to have control of Extraordinary Characteristic (atleast try to fight again indifference and madness that come from the benefit of ability). Protagonist will go to adventure in Black Emperor Path, he is pure Chinese to the bone & soul, the way he see problem and solve problem is really typical Chinese people who study Taoism, his way of thinking is also relevant with my imagination of High Quality Protagonist (only Five Protagonist from different novel so far that get my evaluation of Perfect Protagonist) this guy Hubbart is almost reach that level of perfection."

I also know that the author is really work hard from in between chapter i see in this book, atleast i really enjoy the writing about the battle in this book couple with the writing about Protagonist way of thinking (professional modern man) makes it more interesting."""

If you dont like this book after couple of chapter, i recommend you to read Demonic Cangyue (pen name) work, there is five good book from that author, i recommend read book 4 first to deepen the impression, but chronologically the timeline is book 1-5-2-3-4 (Inhuman Gene, Heaven is not Working today, Brain-hole, Blue and White Sociaty, Omniscient Information)"""

I really enjoyed it, thanks for recommending. Its quite rare to find a LOTM fanfic that isnt a complete power fantasy or extreme on the harem. Anyway, do you have any other recommendations? Maybe also other fanfic of other shows like Naruto."""

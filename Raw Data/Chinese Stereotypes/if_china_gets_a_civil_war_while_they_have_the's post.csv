I just found out during a recent China game that if you get a civil war while you have the opium debuff (NOT the ""Lost the Opium wars"" debuff), its simply game over, since the other side doesn  get the debuff and will crush you. This makes it so you can  win any civil wars while banning the opium trade. Its not like the Chinese people one city away are simply cured of their addiction because the landowners decided to revolt."

I also think that it shouldn’t be a “avoid/win opium war and that’s the end of it” thing. It should be more of a struggle and losing the first opium war should also present an opportunity, because it brought a reason for the Qing to change. Imo there should be two ways to modernise China in game: one by avoiding the war or winning it, and slowly reforming, and one by losing it and have the Qing dynasty turned into a republic as fast as possible."""

victoria3,ConohaConcordia,t2eyp2lek,t1leuh3n2,t1lesmjxd,07/25/24 09:19,3,12,0,1,"""That debuff isn’t that well designed to begin with, because a lot of China’s issues back then wasn’t because of opium addiction but because of an inefficient and archaic bureaucracy and an incompetent, corrupt army. . Opium certainly didn’t help and it led to a massive outflow of silver which hurt the already fragile national treasury. But I would argue the wars with the Europeans did a lot more damage with the concessions and the internal instability they caused. In fact when the Qing dynasty ended, China was a major producer of opium itself. In that context, it’d make sense if the civil war enemies are less corrupt and have a better bureaucracy, so they don’t suffer from the same debuff. They should still get some modifiers related to opium though."""

It ends up causing a huge reactionary civil war that may be winnable if they also got the debuff. Also I do agree that it would make sense to become the winning side of a civil war, but I guess paradox says nah"""

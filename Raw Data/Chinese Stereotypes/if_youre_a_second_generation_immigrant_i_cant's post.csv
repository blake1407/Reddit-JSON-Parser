My folks built their world view at around the time when Hu Yaobang died, which kicked off the 1989 Tiananmen Square Incident. . That generation of educated Chinese people were deeply influenced by Chinas step onto the global stage and in turn, by western ideals. My folks themselves are highly westernized themselves: Both of them speak different foreign languages fluently, and are more inclined to believe that western cultures, political systems etc. are superior to that of the East (not making any political statements here, just an observation). While my folks always played with the idea of immigrating to the West for those ideals, they did not make the step like many of your parents did. . I did however get educated in the United States. After spending several years there, It was made inherently clear to me that being an Asian person in the West was a bad deal. My folks even planned on pouring their lifes savings into the EB-5 Investor immigration program for me and my brother, which both of us turned down. My country has its fair share of problems, some can even argue A LOT of problems. But on an individual level, as a Han Chinese, I at least feel like Im treated like a human being, not get shouted down with imaginary Chinese nonsense by homeless people, or marginalized by both the majority and larger minorities in the country. When I look at people in this subreddit talk about their own and their parents background, a lot (not all) seemed to have come from a place of relative or significant privilege in their home countries. Chances are, if your folks wouldve stayed, you probably wouldve led similar lifestyles comparable to the West, and be treated with dignity without having to suffer the prejudice and racism many of you now face. Curious to hear thoughts or for someone to tell me if Im being way too cynical."

Most of it is a lot of personal and familial stuff, but there are some things that I collectively share with, and feel, with other Asian people here. The feeling of invisibility, of lack of respect, of objectification, of dehumanization. Sometimes, when I talk with white people, Im surprised at how offended they get for slights and injustices, while I just let things slide. Silently, I think, ""if I got that mad every time something like that happened, Id be enraged way too much to be happy."" I put up with a lot of bullshit to maintain my sanity.

I believe personality is mostly inherited, and values grow out of personalities. xa0I’ll use a stark example: very few white men innately feel it’s a part of their responsibility to make major lifelong sacrifices (lifestyle, who they partner with, career) for their children, even if they might say it. xa0Often times kids are abandoned or worse used as a weapon in a divorce. xa0For East Asians it’s normal to feel responsible for our progeny even in the case of a divorce. xa0This overall greater sense of responsibility to others, society, and ourselves and the inability to successfully meet and be culturally rewarded for this sense of responsibility affects us greatly. xa0The things that society rewards are white centric and some don’t have a good overlap with common East Asian personalities (risk taking, Anglo centric charisma, a rebel fuck you attitude, physical toughness). xa0These are traits we must often put on like a costume, for which we can get rewarded, but it feels empty because we don’t get rewarded for other aspects that we often times consider more core to ourselves. If you feel that you don’t want to pass this trauma to your children, then do the work to become successful enough and competent enough in your ancestral culture to live a global lifestyle and make sure your children aren’t locked into Western Anglo society. The recent wave of Chinese immigrants have shown much greater sense of cultural pride on this front. xa0I see it the most with some of the girls at 16-18 who despite moving to America at 2-3, speaks Chinese fluently, uses Chinese social media, and have no real interest in white boys beyond curiosity. xa0A key point is their parents never abandoned China, maintain business and family relations there, and travel back with them frequently. xa0Perhaps there will come a day when Chinese American becomes an actual stable cultural phenomenon, but if it does it will happen through continuous connections with the homeland. As for living conditions for China specifically, the trajectory is clear. xa0Every year life gets better in China for the average person, despite all the negative press we hear. xa0The biggest difference over the last 5 years is that people just trust each other more. xa0Imagine walking around and having the belief that the overwhelming majority of the people around you, pedestrians, clients, bosses, servers, policemen, neighbors are good, decent people who aren’t out to take advantage of you. xa0That dramatically changes how much weight you carry and your quality of life. Pollution and corruption 15 years before. xa0The ability to pursue economic activities and physical movement 25 years before. xa0The threat of starvation 35 years before. xa0I don’t see how anyone can point at issues of economic inequality or extreme competition now in China and think that it’s any more intractable for the country to solve compared to the other major seemingly intractable problems that it did manage to solve at breakneck speed over the last 50 years."""

I think many of the negative experiences on this reddit are those whose families decided to immigrate to non diverse areas of the US where theres no established Asian communities or do not attract large numbers of immigrants for whatever reason, rather than cosmopolitan areas like New York or maybe for your equivalent Shanghai. My other guess is that these non diverse communities are also economically stagnant or old money areas, so immigrants coming to these areas are joining in the low wage service vs professional sectors so its a hard climb up. So these areas might not be a great environment for kids whose families are below the areas average income regardless, race and culture would add to thexa0 hurdle.

I do remember taking a class once which discussed and compared different types of “freedoms” offered in the US vs China (among other countries). Apparently, while Western countries are used to hearing about values of political freedom, including freedom of speech, other nations place more value on the freedom that comes with economic growth and stability- and to some extent, there is a belief that you must prioritize one over the other. I’m not sure it’s truly a one-or-the-other decision, because many countries place importance on both sets of values. But I can see how in China, the fact that the economic growth has been tied to the actions of a politically repressive government makes those things appear connected, and recent memories of extreme poverty drive people to avoid returning to that no matter what it takes. And if the result is that most people don’t dissent enough for the government to care, then most people probably feel like they have all the political freedom they want, in addition to the economic stability they want. Even better if everyone sees that you can get involved in local government and have disagreements with political officials without anything bad automatically happening to you. I know you aren’t going to personally know the answers to the following questions if your parents left China when you were a kid, or before you were born. But I am curious what people think when actual dissenters like your family get hauled off to prison, particularly if a number of people quietly agreed with some of what they had been saying. Do people think imprisoning the dissenters was justified, because they may have been a threat to things such as economic prosperity and China’s global reputation? Is there an “oh shit, we DO live in an autocracy” moment? If the latter, can people then discuss their new concerns about their political freedom being limited, without being punished for having that discussion?

Either accidentally or intentionally, you provided an extremely important context for my post: the situation for Mainland Chinese Im describing singularly applies to the 1980s generation of university-educated citizens. Leaving right after the Communist takeover because of persecution is 100% understandable. As for western ideals of freedoms and the ability to have a voice without repercussions, I understand that fully as well. . However, as someone who has experienced both systems, I want to point out that the experience of living in either cultures (USA v. China) is a bit more nuanced than saying one has political freedom and that the other suffers from political oppression. The iron grip you speak of does exist, but for a lot of people living here, its not a determinant factor to whether you stay or leave. The reason for this is many-fold, and may differ from person to person:.  Most people don  know anything else: Mainland China has NEVER experienced a truly democratic system. We went almost straight from the Qing Dynastic Order to Yuan Shikai (a small detour with the Sun Zhongshan led revolution), to War Lord control, Chiang Kai Sheks consolidation of power, and a few major external and internal conflicts later, to Communist China. the ""Iron Grip"", while it exists, has been the norm of this entire region since the onset of organized culture (I want to refrain from the use of the word civilization here).   For Han Chinese (HUGE CAVEAT), you don  really ""feel"" it: Western rhetoric of the oppressive Chinese political system carries a sinister undertone that the Chinese are just naturally more subservient. I would argue that this is untrue. The truth of the matter is that CCPs power stems from societal harmony and as such, they have spent a TON of time cultivating it through building up the economy, improving peoples lives, and to make living here as pleasant as possible for the majority. This is not an endorsement of Chinas political system. I myself have a lot of issues with even just the structure, and especially the current regime. Its simply illustrating a point that due to the CCPs need to hold onto power, they have spent actual time trying to at least maintain an acceptable, even comfortable standard of living for its citizens (something it is trying and failing to do now).      The Caveat: If youre a rather sinicized minority (Zhuang, Manchu, Mongol), life isn  that different for you. However, if youre from the far reaches of the country (Uighur, Kazakh, Tibetan), life fucking sucks for you. Marginalized groups sometimes don  even have the right to leave their physical locations, and even were they able to do so, they run into a ton of trouble trying to secure jobs, even housing in other Han majority areas."""

I brought up examples of Chinese leaving much more dire situations, situations bad enough that they would have been worse off staying in China, despite facing racism in their new homes. . The OP has already responded thoughtfully about my point and specified they were meaning to talk about those middle class immigrants of the 80s-90s.

I made a list of anti-Chinese government statements I had made in my previous comment, statements that I thought might show what you call my “complete ignorance of China,” and I invited you to refute them. I also invited you to bring up any other such statements I made and refute those too. You refuted none of the statements I listed. The only one you brought up was my reference to famines which did not happen in your lifetime, and your response was that those mid-century famines hasn’t prevented you personally from living well, in the 21st century. That’s nice, but I never suggested those famines had affected you personally, so that is irrelevant. They did, however, affect millions of other Chinese people, and I think you know you can’t claim otherwise. Items 1-3 on my list are historical, but 4 and 5 are current and they do inherently affect you, as a Chinese national currently living in China from what I can gather. Thus I’m trying to understand why you find items 4 and 5 to be moot. Do you not care that your government suppresses speech and views that it finds potentially harmful to itself? Or do you think it doesn’t engage in such suppressive tactics and any evidence of it doing so is “fake news”? Do you not care that you live under in an authoritarian, arguably totalitarian state? Or do you think that neither of those adjectives applies to your government (so, also “fake news”)?. Refute items 4 and 5? Show why they are moot?. You did bring up a couple of other points to demonstrate that I am “completely ignorant about China.”. The first was that I’ve never been there, while you’ve lived there for a decade and a half. And I’m sure I lack a lot of knowledge about various aspects of daily Chinese life, including day to day experience of political life, as compared with you.

Just as you, who have spent far, far less time in the US than I have, can bring up the Chinese Exclusion Act and massacres of coolies- things you have only read about. . I cannot dismiss your points about US history and governance just because I think you haven’t spent enough time living in the US. The same applies to you, regarding points I bring up about China. So, no, my not having lived in China does not go to show that I am completely ignorant about the topics we are discussing, particularly given that there is a ton of written information about these topics. Another point you bring up is that you are quite happy living in China. As I mentioned in my last reply, that is great. I do not doubt that you are happier. However, I never claimed that Chinese people living in China are not happy as a rule. I think that I personally wouldn’t be happy with the system of government, and that is what I said in my original comment, when I stated that I am glad my family left. I don’t assume that everyone shares my priorities or feelings, though, and I never said I did. . Finally, the Chinese Exclusion Act and historic massacres. Lol, I guess I could follow your lead and point point out that neither of those things have ever affected me personally, thus they don’t matter to me, and so you bringing them up shows that you are ignorant of the experience of Americans of Chinese descent. I won’t do that. It’s true that those things have never affected me personally, just as the famines never affected you personally. And the politicians who supported the law, and the people who did the massacring, are all dead at this point. Nevertheless, those events are stains on American history. . In fact, American history is covered with stains. You could write a list in your reply of things the US government has done that were terrible, and I would likely say your list is correct and you are right to dislike and distrust the government. I certainly wouldn’t whitewash US history just because I personally like living here, which is what you seem tempted to do. And that brings me back around to a key difference between our chosen countries. I can speak freely to anyone about the things that reflect poorly on our country, including things relating to people who are currently in power. . Here’s a 1:1 example: I can openly discuss the many instances in which the U.S. government has used military or paramilitary troops to suppress the will of its people and has sometimes killed those people.

Chances are, if your folks would’ve stayed, you probably would’ve led similar lifestyles comparable to the West, and be treated with dignity without having to suffer the prejudice and racism many of you now face. The Chinese diaspora is centuries long, and people’s situations in China and thus their reasons for leaving have changed much over this time. People like to oversimplify immigration as “seeking better economic opportunity” but in reality, each and every potential immigrant makes a complex decision on whether to go through with it, not to mention where to go, based on their geopolitical understandings plus individual factors such as where they’ve got family already. . You are specifically talking about the 1980s-90s diaspora in which educated middle class Chinese moved to Western countries, particularly in North America, and succeeded financially, but at the cost of inadvertently opening up their kids and grandkids to experiencing a particular brand of North American racism against Asians. Sure - maybe they would have done well, financially speaking, by staying in China as your family did, and not brought on the racism. Win win. . On the other hand, are you sure that aspiring to greater economic success was the only reason why other Chinese left around that time? You mention Tiananmen Square, you say your country has a lot of problems. You’ve likely got an idea of why Chinese people would want to go live in a different political system. Perhaps, if you hold the financial success variable constant, it comes down to living with casual racism vs living under political oppression. I can’t make that choice for anyone, but its existence does expand the conversation to include more than relative financial prosperity. To provide another counterpoint, my family, which also had some money, left China 40+ years before the era you brought up. Reason was the civil war. Family history has is that my family literally had to flee in the middle of the night in order to avoid being killed. . (I’ve tried to fill in the gaps in this story- were they fleeing a class rebellion? Did they support the Kuomintang and were about to be snitched on for this and executed? I wish I knew more.). Anyway, they settled in the Philippines and after that, Taiwan (and my mom moved to the US in the 1970s). They became pretty financially successful there. They still consider themselves Chinese, and they’ve run into a great deal of conflict with the existing locals- particularly Filipinos- which has made their lives more difficult for sure. One of their restaurants once burned down (long time ago) because the Filipino fire brigade would not put it out. Yes, in China they would have been Chinese like everyone else and they wouldn’t have had those conflicts. But money or not, perhaps because of their money, they would have long since been killed in China. Or the ones who managed to survive the CCP victory would have soon encountered through the terrible famines of the mid 20th century, and the Cultural Revolution. Quite a bit worse than what they dealt with as members of an ethnic minority in the Philippines. Fast forward to now. Maybe in this day, financially well off Chinese can count on having a good life in China and so they need not consider emigrating and forcing their children to struggle socially in a new place?. But that is questionable. The world can see that the CCP and Xi Jinping have an iron grip over the Chinese people, including the wealthy and connected, never mind the middle and working classes. Even moderate political disagreement is a risk. People will answer that question in different ways. Personally, I vastly prefer that my family left. Yeah, I’ve heard slurs. Physically, I stand out. There’s people in the US who don’t think of me as a real American. But I live under a system where I can make any political statements I wish- something very important to me. Personally I would rather face some racism in the US (and I have), rather than live in a place where I visually fit in, but am under the control of a totalitarian government.

My ex pointed this out by saying her average friends in China seem much less scared to do what they want and spend money on others compared to me, despite also working harder in school and work (ouch). Similarly, my parents’ peers in China seemed to always be living it up, despite making less money they could pay for fun things they wanted and spend time vacationing, while my parents work like 60 hours a week and have to beg for PTO. I used to be overly grateful to my parents because I thought they did a great thing by emigrating and escaping from poverty and whatever. Then I resented them for robbing me of a normal childhood, preventing me from living in China which I always felt patriotic towards, and forcing me to grow up with insane racism and alienation without any support whatsoever.

Chinese people are taught to unconditionally respect their parents and their parents decisions. But the truth is, our parents decided wrong. There is no endgame for Asian America. Zero solidarity from other minorities; endless White worship; eternally poor achievement-to-payoff ratio. Fresh partners from the motherland necessary to create children with a cultural identity at least as strong as our own; failing that, hapa and quapa and octapa dilution, until extinction. If we look in from the outside, theres no reason a perpetually hated minority will ever be accepted and assimilated. To wit, a fifth-generation Asian is less American than a first-generation European. Almost every avenue of successful occupation besides coolie, mental or physical, is closed to Asians in the West. Every Asian child is bound to face racial abuse in the school system. As an Asian, the more you develop Western proficiency, the more you become a walking contradiction — an Asian body performing White tasks with zero appeal to either audience. Ive posted about this before:. Your ""price tag"" thinking is correct. Immigration is a trade-off. Immigrants ""purchase"" the (relative) economic success of the host country. They ""pay"" in racial rejection: undesirable jobs, undesirable social status, undesirable partners. Counter-intuitively, though, the bill often doesn  come due until a generation later. First-generation immigrants underestimate and under-experience these costs. Theyre more familiar with their homelands problems. They have less of a read on unfavorable racial dynamics of the host country. And in a way, theyre better equipped to fight the effects of ostracism: they can retreat to their insular homeland communities. All these defenses fall away with the second generation. For us, there is neither White acceptance nor homeland acceptance, just a world of bamboo ceilings in all facets of life — mutts by life history if not genetics. Heres an older, oft-circulated essay on the topic, as well as a rejoinder. One more thing to highlight is that pure colorism is also at play: White immigrants from any country have a much easier time finding acceptance than Asian immigrants. And also:. Parent-led White worship is quite an underexamined hidden factor in the Asian experience. Asian parents, particularly first-generation ones, often play their influence on their childrens prospects into White-worship. Asian parents of daughters will put the tremendous pressure of traditional Asian expectations (career? house? car? total subservience?) on a prospective AM son-in-law, but kowtow timidly around a WM partner running roughshod (literally) over all cultural mores. To make things worse for us, this is mirrored backwards to the detriment of AM when we flip it for the AMXF minority. Asian parents of sons often disapprove of non-Asian, even WF, partners: XF wouldn  understand or respond to their daughter-in-law demands. Consider this quote: ""Co-ethnics are favored because they presumably share similar norms, but that also means they are subject to more monitoring and punishment if they violate those norms."" In other words, the ""realpolitik"" tradeoff of being an in-group member is that you receive valuable favor for performing costly norms. But AM receive no such favor! Asian culture is unique, or at least uniquely superlative, in punishing its own men. in favor of WM. If Asian culture fails this taken-for-granted litmus test, are we really even an in-group? As an AM, not only do you get the cold shoulder from a huge percentage of Whites, but you can easily get the same from a huge percentage of co-ethnics. And you don  get the social leg up that comes with being a woman, either. Our parents came to the West to dodge problems at home. Perhaps the problems they faced were more acute at the time: war, famine, revolution. But in hindsight, Asian American immigration was a mistake, costing the second generation our childhoods and very likely our entire lives. Because in the long term, Eastern turmoil has abated, whereas Western racism endures forever; native Asia is on the rise, while Asian America will never achieve anything. Whites will never stop being racist — not to Black people, not to Asians. And if we dream of a world where our home countries prosper, then anti-Asian sentiment will only increase. We are perpetual foreigners precisely because our home countries represent a challenge to Western hegemony. We Asian Americans do not belong here. We are an unwelcome stateless people, and despite our proficiency with Western culture, and whatever our deficiencies with our homeland culture, repatriation, or at least an international lifestyle, is the only long-term answer."""

You are correct. Many of us are now successful but had to overcome unreasonable obstacles and suffering. Our parents- who came here for an extra buck, and most could have had a middle/upper-middle class life in their home countries- subjected us to experiences in childhood that really no child should endure- the lack of belonging, the discrimination of double standards - which is the true scourge facing Asians in the West (constant unfairness and differences in how people are treated)- a constant sense that were not good enough (not good looking, not desirable, not ""with it"", etc.), etc. The ""Immigrant as Hero"" false narrative is pitched by the West precisely to elevate the money-grubbing immigrant as some kind of noble soul while gaslighting the unacceptable treatment of Asians boys and daughters during their formative years in America. The Mainstream Media entirely censors the perspective and hardships of 2nd gen Asians.  It is excluded from wider discussion in society. Instead everyone hails the greedy immigrant who abandoned his family, neglected his parents as they got old, failed to brace his children for life in this ""foreign"" environment, who disregarded the racial challenges they would face in their defenseless youth and impressionable stage, for pursuing ""more money than he could make back home"" (as if this is some noble achievement). We must not bring a purely negative mindset to this; but enough criticism is warranted to counteract the prevailing ""Immigrant Hero"" narrative."""

chinalife,Hejin57,t2_e5yvv,t3_1eatpp3,,07/24/24 01:40,0,170,0.88,73,"""If youre an expat. As a dog owner now (not by choice, but still I believe it was meant to be and I would give away everything before her) it saddens me to see the amount of people who move here and adopt pets from the street or friends or shelters only to give them away when moving cities or going back home. I dont care if this comes off as strong, but I feel it needs to be said because this appears to be a particular problem in the expat community: animals are not toys.  They are not something you can pick up and put down when you feel like it.  And just because some Chinese people do not feel as strongly about pet companionship does not give you the excuse to be the same. If youre lonely, go make some friends or go find a girlfriend/boyfriend.  Do not adopt or get a pet unless you actually are willing to make the sacrifices to keep it, and if god forbid something happens, have to take it back with you. For those who are good pet owners, have had to bring their dog or cat back to their home country and etc., I have the uptmost respect for you, because being a pet owner is not easy in the slightest."

Countries are categorised based on their exposure to viruses such as rabies. For countries like Australia and New Zealand (both category 1) it is impossible to get your pet directly from China (Cat 3) to there. They need to spend at least 6 months (among other requirements) in a different country (category 2). The cost to get a pet to Australia specifically is very high because they can only go by cargo, they cannot fly on the airline with you and they must fly into Melbourne and go directly to a government quarantine facility (which needs to be booked months in advance and is not cheap). Countries like the UK and the US are much simpler and don’t require quarantine, usually. For the UK, it’s easier to fly into France and get the ferry to the UK.

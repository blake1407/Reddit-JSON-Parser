About the chinese governament, the question is why is a page that has Marxism in its name so friendly to capitalism?.  Stalinists, Maoists and pro-Chinese people stain the reputation of Marxism and communism. "

Well you should need to look to the side of this admins, they propably get tons of Anti communist liberal non sense in the comments and they dont got the time to look on every stupid comment. And as i said youre comment just doesnt look real different of an Anti Communist liberal besides the fact that youre against the capitalist restauration but i think you know what i mean."""

Trotskyism,Korax30,t2vpx08byk,t1lbfyaao,t1lbfw5r2,07/03/24 09:55,2,4,0,2,""">1. Calling something ""Authoritarian"" isnt a good critic. A state is always ""Authoritarian"" thats just a normal thing and a proletarian state is ""Authoritarian"" too. I understand that the very existence of the state is an imposition, but it is also true that in China the limitations on freedom are much heavier than elsewhere; my criticism was of undemocratic communism. >2. Calling Mao ""Anti Communist"" is ridiculous. Even if his tactics or theorys wont succed for Communism, that doesnt mean he is ""Anti Communism"" he just has wrong ideas. Mao was a communist and he believed he will achieve it through the things he did or the CCP did, same goes with stalin btw. The other thing with this ""call out"" is that youve never criticized anything mao or the CCP did. The socialist state should, in my opinion, aim to eliminate classes, which is why the idea of  he privileged bureaucrat is non-egalitarian. Mao certainly believed he was rightly pursuing Marxism, but in fact he used a method that was at odds with this ideology!. >3. ""A socialist country should never adopt capitalism"" idk where youve got that take. Probably not from lenin or the history of the SU. Of course you cant compare the NEP to the current china Situation but saying that a Socialist country should never ever do such thing is ridiculous. . I meant that Den Xiapings choice to open up to the free market has nothing Marxist about it, and betrays the revolution by recreating the bourgeoisie. The Soviet NEP was, as you said, a very different thing, which did not risk creating a new bourgeoisie. Anyway, thanks so much for the advice, I appreciate people who know how to criticize without being aggressive! However, I am disappointed by the fact that in a Marxist community discussion between different currents is not allowed."""

So after all youre right in the sense of saying that China is a capitalist and imperialist country. But you should control youre feelings, there was literally no critique of China it was just a angry call out guided by feelings rather than marxist theory. This shit could have been written by some Anti Communist liberal instead of a marxist. So its okay to Ban you for that comment. I mean you can try to write the admins and apologize while criticizing China."""

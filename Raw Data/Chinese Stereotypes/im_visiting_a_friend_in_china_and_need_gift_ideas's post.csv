Hi all, Im from Australia and will be visiting a friend in China (mid 20s, girl) whilst Im travelling. Im planning to bring her a gift since she offered to show me around for a day or 2. What sort of gifts would Chinese people enjoy from Australia? Snacks? Wine? Random Aussie stuffed animal? Any suggestions welcome. Thanks!"

""In Asia, if the Asian woman marries a black guy, their family will disown her!!"" Im not sure about other parts of Asia but this is not true in Japan in this day and age. Maybe not completely true in Japan.  though I don  think thats the majority.  This shows theres obviously a discrepancy between white-japanese and black-japanese. I mean even Naomi Osaka has said shes faced racism in Japan.  . I also know asian friends who have dated and married black people.  but theyre more exceptions to the rule. There are definitely more cases where Ive known friends/people say they would never date/marry a black person because of the backlash and issues theyd have with their family. So I don  know how they said it that makes you think its a lie, but its really not for the majority of asia.  there is undeniable pretty prevalent racism and colourism in most if not all asian countries. The government literally runs ads/PSAs here (asia) telling landlords not to be racist and not rent to south and southeast asian/african tennants.  My south/SEAsian/black friends here have told me how difficult it is for them to find places to live because theyll get incredibly blatant racism and get flat out denied. (And FTR, I live in a more culturally and racially diverse/accepting big eastasian city than Tokyo ). half-white Chinese people living in China as a Chinese receive no backlash compared to monoracial Chinese people. ?. Obviously not true since thats a giant generalisation.  If anybody does something warranting backlash, theyll get backlash whether half white or monoracial  but theres definitely white privilege. You really can  deny that. And these incels always refer to models and celebrities.  Those people still fought against thousands of other competitors to be in the limelight. Uhh.  Maybe. But the bar for international/mixed models is definitely lower in Asia. I mean the objective measure for height requirements in models is basically non-existent in asia.  definitely even more lax if youre a mixed-white/white model/celebrity. I live in asia, have been scouted in japan, hk, sgp, etc.  (as have my mixed parents and brothers).  and have some friends/friends of friends, classmates (both mixed and white) who became/are quite famous local models. They (nor I) would ever make it big in a white predominant country/city. , its just fact. I don  deny they probably have thousands of other competitors.  but monoracials in their own countries have even more competitors than that.  and a less obvious/visible selling point. So Im not sure thats really an argument  cus again.  white/mixed-whites just simply have privilege in Asia. Itd be plain ignorant to deny white-prviliege here. Ignorant Asian seniors (50s and above) might say something ignorant but theyd never be that upfront!. Albeit, this isn  the norm.  but it happens.  I think they would be if they think/know you understand the language.  Ive seen that happen to white and brown people in Japan. Then the other half would just make these kind of statements passive aggressively behind your back knowing/assuming youd not understand/respond. . xa0r hapas subreddit, these Asian incels really need to stop blaming everything on race. Thoughts?. Yeah, I do agree with that. I think Ive looked at that subreddit before, its pretty disgusting and pathetic in there. So Im not arguing with you that incel/ricel views are stupid/pathetic/disgusting and wrong.  Im definitely 100% with you on that, but those specific things you mentioned.  I wouldn  and really couldn  call them (complete) lies.   . edit: clarity."""

A good explainer here. I know the mods at r asianamerican struggle with keeping a lid on these kinds of posters, particularly the misogynistic ones. Which isn  to say that anti-Blackness and colorism doesn  exist more broadly in both the Asian-American community and Asia generally.  Its definitely tougher to be Asian/Black than it is to be Asian/white, particularly in Asia. You cite the example of Japan, which has a growing population of Blasians, but there are plenty of examples of Black/Japanese mixed folks who have described the challenges they face.  Naomi Osaka has talked about the racism she experienced, but here is also an article interviewing the average Blasian in Japan. As for r hapas, the toxicity of the sub seems like a reflection of the personal struggles of the posters there.  It feels like many of them grew up in toxic family situations and inferred it was a question of the racial pairing of their parents, rather than more general familial problems.  They seem to internalize it and struggle with self loathing. Also, they don  use the word correctly.  ""Hapa"" is an adjective, not a noun.  One is ""hapa"", not ""a hapa"".

Fixed keyboard layouts use shift key a lot for Bangla (which is not needed when typing in English). This repeated usage of shift key drops typing speed.   On the other hand, phonetic input methods reduce the flexibility of what you can type.   Chinese people can type faster than English. Which is incredible for a complex writing system.   I took inspiration from the Chinese technique Pinyin and tried to develop an input method that does not need shift key at all, besides it can also (optionally) learn from your typing and suggest relevant words with the aid of typing-booster.

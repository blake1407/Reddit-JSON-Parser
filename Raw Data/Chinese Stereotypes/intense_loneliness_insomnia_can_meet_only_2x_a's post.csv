My girlfriend is Chinese and I got deported from her country for 5 years (I made shorts of me meeting my girlfriend for the first time after covid, and Chinese people made a fake rumor that I have HIV and had sx with her and posted the rumor it on their social media and it spread, then I went to Xinjiang and the police there arrested me because I was in a sensitive place). She lacks object constancy, when we are together we hug all the time, laugh, hold hands, when we separate we quarrel over chat for 14 hrs to 17 hrs a day, she sends me a message every 3 minutes and if I don  reply she suspects me of cheating and scolds me. She just graduated from college and decided to work in this summer vacation, and also decided to pursue Masters degree, we will not be able talk or meet anymore. At most 3 times a year (February, June, August). I looked at her type of work and if all stars align she could earn 600$ a month maximum in 3 years. I said is it really worth to kill our relationship and 3 years of your youth for this? I have been paying her tickets, over 4k$ in 4 months I can perfectly support her if she decides not to study or work, we can be together right now. But I respect her decision. Meanwhile she also does not let me meet other people, or chat with others. I myself travel in Thailand (because it is convenient for her to visit, China and Thailand have visa free scheme), over 600 women (mostly prostitutes) have approached me over 4 months, and I rejected all of those. I basically lie down watching the ceiling, waiting for my girlfriends messages, then binge eating (gained 15 kg in 5 months). I also cannot sleep and have derealization. I love my girlfriend extremely much and so does she, I am very happy with her. Also we tried breaking up for like an hour and she went absolutely crazy crying and shaking and I cried too, then she said please don  break up and we are still together. I have no idea how to tackle this situation. She is loyal so far, so am I. We both can see each others phones freely, and also app usage records. Recently I suffer from derealization (everything feels fake and dreamy) and feel very numb, this intense loneliness is so painful, it feels like I am in an empty white room, in a prison. The only way out now is to end my life, or in secrecy meet with other women. But I am afraid this eventually will lead to sx in 99% of the time (from past experiences), even now is summer vacation, some Chinese women from the past sexted with me, I showed my girlfriend then she said ""you are free to do what you want to do with them, but you also shall bear the consequences if I don  love you anymore"" . I really don  know what to do anymore. "

Also if she is so in love and wants to be with you so bad, why does care more apparently for her university? I feel like this is not healthy when its so fixated, another option you have is indeed go on about the relationship more openly. Have you and her see other people and be fine with it without guilt or jealousy. Right, you need to strive for what makes you happy in life even in the small moments and not take yourself so serious."""

I said so too, we can live in the Netherlands, I live alone, then we study English (she can read and translate sentences flawlessly, able to write broken English, but not understand it well and cant follow conversations at all unless speak very slowly), save money then pursue your masters, in Netherlands you get quadruple the salary, better working conditions, but she needs to present a Hukou (at least) and her parents will not give it to her, she already passed some really painful exams to get into this University, also has monthly scholarship from her government, to suddenly say go stop studying is hard."""

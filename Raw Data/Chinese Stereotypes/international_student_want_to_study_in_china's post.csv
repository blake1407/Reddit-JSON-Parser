Hello im from Saudi Arabia and our government offers a great scholarships to china+usa and other countries . The thing is that the scholarship didn’t accept me in usa because its already full with students , but i think there is still a chance to china. So technically Im not worried about tuition&money at all. But im worried about other things so i want to ask some questions:. . 1- is studying computer science in mandrian language will something i will regret? . 2-the scholarship will offer a one year to study mandrian and after that i must pass HSK5 to continue , so can i make through this year? Can i pass the exam& learn madrian only for 1 year?. . 3- is the chinese people nice? A lot of saudis say they had good experience with them , but how to communicate if I don’t know mandarin? . 4- im hijabi woman will that be a problem? . 5- where can i find Chinese people on social media? Because I can’t find them anywhere  i want to know about the popular apps they have there "

Unless you’re doing 5 hours+ of studying every day, it’ll be really difficult. Trust me language prep programs, especially the ones specifically tailored for scholarship students (class from 8:30-12:00 and 13:30-17:30 from Monday to Saturday + assignments), and some self-studying can get you to that level. It is true that OP will have to study like life depended on it to reach that level but it can definitely be achieved."""

But they’re generally very friendly. Especially to Middle Eastern people. Might come off as racist, but trust me, they’re just curious and mean no offense. . 4. Lots of attention. Not a problem. . 5.

I know coding is coding but as for computer science Im not too sure. As for for stress factor. Id say lets take Cornell university for example quite a bit of time traveling on campus either walking up and down hills or would need a car. Buses are quite unreliable. NYU also unless you can afford really expensive housing youll have to take public transit or drive which lets be real NY public transit and traffic isnt amazing . . From what I see in China depending on city. Even if you live far from campus a electric moped will be adequate transportation if not lets take Xiamen for example they have a highway built above regular roads dedicated to buses to get you around the city. xa0Campuses are compact not much traveling from one building down a few blocks to another. They dont have to spread their buildings out like in the u.s. The area in the city Im visiting now has 3 different colleges in one area of the city all withing a few minutes walk. Each specializing in different fields from what Im told. The moment you step out of the college there is a street thats about 2km+ long block. Filled with desserts, bbq, sit down restaurants, hair salons, bars etc think of it like a mall street everything youd need down one straight streets. Take out is easier wechat. Taxis wechat. Medicine? WeChat. If you know what you need such as antibiotics or anything else just drop by pharmacy no need for description. Medicine is cheap. $3-4 USD for antibiotics. TLDR: my experience in America having grew up there. Traveling is a huge burden unless you can afford housing close to campus which is about x2-3 the local rent. If you choose to Dorm. Youd have a roommate and would need to move everything out during breaks. I use to have to drive about 45-1 hour to school as living in a dorm just seemed like a pain. Roommates snoring, sloppy, etc. . So imo its far less stressful attendingxa0 college in china. Everything is made to be quite convenient. Theyll have exchange students also but just not as many as youll see in a major American University. For a one bedroom apartment itll probably cost you about 1000-3000 RMB a month once again depending on city. Also they have a high speed rail that connects major cities so if you want to travel during breaks if student visas allow its quite easy. There are benefits to both weigh your options. Learning a 3rd language as you already know English will be a plus but if you find learning new languages hard go with an U.s. college. Once again in the U.s. depending on state you cant get around without a car."""

Hello everyone, I am Chinese Canadian guy and visited KL and Penang. It was definitely amazing (both the people and the food!), and I want to come back to visit East Malaysia next time. . On the first day in KL, I was exploring by myself, near a mosque, when the call for prayer came, one young man in a group of three screamed Allahu akbar, in almost a joking fashion. He didn’t seem too serious in his tone and was laughing about it. He only did that after he saw me. Coming to Malaysia, I was aware of the existing tensions between Chinese and Malays. Is this something that happens to Chinese people here or am I overthinking things here (sorry I’m an ignorant North American haha). . I was also traveling with my Russian girlfriend. She’s blond and naturally attracted a lot of attention. She said there was quite a bit of catcalling when she was by herself, and some of the stares the men were giving her was really uncomfortable. Is this also normal? I thought KL is a very international city, so young female visitors must be common place?. "

Here it is more politically driven and as long as OP does everything as a respectable human he will be fine. Our racism is more policy based, disadvantages on certain things and if you get involved in a fight (even so i think there are ways you can manage it without it being a racist issue).

I patronized an empty hongeo ramyeon place in Mokpo and had a long in-depth conversation with a kind ajumma who just kept feeding me and sharing about her town to me. I was sitting at a park bench in the evening in Suncheon Bay and an elderly grandpa starts conversing with me in English and told me all about his life working with the Americans during the War. We were in Gwangju and a taxi ajeossi pointed out every single recommendation on the ride from Songjeong Station to Downtown Gwangju and ended up picking bottles of water for us at a quick stop so we werent too thirsty in the back seat on a hot summer day. In Damyang, we met a group of ajummas who greeted us with Hellos at the bamboo forest and shared some gimbap at the top of the hill while we talked about marriage plans. Ive lived in Seoul for a few years and am currently living in Busan for the past few years, both metropolitan cities and I have visited or lived in the other provinces as well. Jeolla and Jeju are by far the most accepting people because theyre more liberal. I personally think if its any group that can elicit more likeliness for racist behavior its Gyeongsang people. The Korean people youre talking to are probably conservative bigot Gyeongsang people whod probably call Jeolla people Hongeos (stingrays - derogatory term). Theyve had regional beef with Jeolla people since time immemorial as far back as Three Kingdoms period, made worse during the Park and Chun dictatorship period."""

Most of the time if you hear whispering then just ignore it. Sometimes its fascination, sometimes its them talking about something completely unrelated to you. I think so long as you try to be polite and considerate, you will generally have a great time! .

The only weird interaction we had was inside Lotte World Mall, two  on a bench beside us asked how we were enjoying ourselves in Korea and then called my friend very white (all in Korean).

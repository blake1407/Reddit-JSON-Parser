Im not really knowledgeable in biology or genetics, but what I essentially understood from a friend of mine is the following and Id like to make sure that its correct:. 1. My genome is the instructions to build me specifically. 2. The genome is essentially a single chain of billions of 4-letter combinations (ATCG). 3. So lets say my genome is: ATTGCAG billions. 4. That genome is unique to every individual. 5. If I compare my chain of letters to someone elses chain of letters the less differences there are, the more closely were related. 6. That means that there are the least differences between me and my parents and siblings, compared to anyone else in the world. Ok, so now I understand that were basically a chain of letters. So heres how DNA testing comes in:. 8. I collect 10 000 Yemeni peoples genomes, so now I have 10 000 chains of letters. 9. I average those chains of letter into one. 10. I collect 10 000 Chinese peoples genomes and average those chains into one, representing the average Chinese person. 11. I repeat that process for every single country on earth, I now have the average chains of letters that represents the average person from every single country on earth. 12. I extract my own chains of letters and I juxtapose it onto all those averaged chains of letters I have. 13. The one that has the least difference is the nation Im probably from. So lets say my lowest % difference is with the average Yemeni chains of letters, that means that Im Yemeni. Now heres where the percentages come in (admixture):. 14. Every averaged chains of letters of every nation will have a special little set of letters that represent them (biomarker?), so for instance we notice that at the 938827th position in the genome, the Chinese people have those letters ""ATTGA"" which other countries don  have. 15. My lowest % difference is with the average Yemeni, but I have the ""AATGA"" at the 938827th position. That means Im Yemeni and Chinese. 16. Statistically, with those multiple localized differences, I can statistically say that Im 17% Chinese and 83% Yemeni (not sure about the actual statistics behind it though). Is my surface-level comprehension good? Is that actually how it works?. The only part that confuses me is when DNA tests claim that they can only go 300 years back. Im not sure what that means or why its relevant if Im being compared to the current populations genome."

If there is a question that you want to answer maybe that can be translated into nontechnical language. . Ancestry analysis is a type of “dimension reduction” — takes a high dimensional data space and finds some of its structure. It’s good to remember that ancestry isn’t “real”; it’s a simplification. . If you were a graduate student, I would recommend to start laying the foundation by studying population genetics to get intuitions about mutation, selection, migration, drift, recombination, and assortative mating. Begin to understand linkage and linkage disequilibrium. Don’t worry about the math until you have these concepts in your personal toolkit."""
genetics,geneticdriftin,t2nsu6cyk,t1leghfkj,t1legcykl,07/22/24 12:33,2,1,0,0,"""Not sure what you mean by area of averages. Its averages over multiple dimensions. Let me just jump in and explain a bit more of the details of how we get from strings of letters (full sequences), to a sample  of letters (usually SNPs), to numbers.  Which of course should be much easier to understand how you convert numbers to averages. Ancestry tests don  usually use sequences directly, they use SNPs.   . SNPs are ""single nucleotide polymorphisms"".  The really important part is polymorphism.  Its basically the parts of the human sequence that tend to be vary (i.e. be ""polymorphic"") which makes them ""informative"".  Ill come back later to how using raw sequences is more complicated, but Ill skip that step for now. The G and T here would be SNPs.  The As aren  useful for most purposes. Individual 1: AAAAGAAAAAAA. Individual 2: AAAATAAAAAAAA. So geneticists including most ancestry tests, just look for those differences.  Thats why youll hear about how 23andmes chip only samples 500K to 1Million SNPs.  We only look at these SNPs because its cheaper, easier to analyze, and in 80% of applications, its all thats needed.  To put it simply, its a lot cheaper than a whole genome sequence, which is 3.1 billion.   . . Now, it gets simpler.  The vast majority of SNPs are biallelic -- you don  get A, G, C, and T.  So we usually convert this to 0 and 1.  or -1 and 1, or 0, 1, 2, but thats just a coding issue when you see variations. You have a ton of 0s and 1s.  These each represent a separate dimension.  I said theres a million SNPs, so a million dimensions is a bit unwieldy.  How do I make this easier to work with?. Well, SNPs tend to cluster together because SNPs are colocated on the same chromosome AND surprise surprise, humans tend to be related (haplotypes). E.g. What you might see for a small population. Individual 1 SNP scores: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Individual 2 SNP scores: 0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1. Individual 3 SNP scores: 0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1. Notice how a lot of these 0s and 1s are redundant.  You could simplify this to. Individual 1: 0,0,0. Individual 2: 0,0,1. Individual 3: 0,1,1. Thats the basis of a ""dimension reduction.""  Its a bit more mathy and effective than that, but its not much more complex conceptually. From, here, you should be able to apply the averaging that youre talking about. Using what you were saying, say we had an individual that was 1,1,1.  Well, Id say they were most closely related to individual.  You could even calculate a distance (which there are many ways to do).  And using your concept, we can have averages that are decimal places across many dimensions (but not 1 million dimensions). Going back for a bit, raw sequences are aligned first.  Its has similarities to how a Google search works.  But after the alignment, geneticists usually just look for the interesting parts like the SNPs. Hope that helps."""

Principle components are just a reduction in dimensions. The major clustering principle is to just find the middle in that space. You can literally get coordinates (like x,y,z, except its usually labeled PC1,2,3). And youre also spot on that the letters are usually converted to numbers.  With SNPs is usually just 0 and 1 though."""

Each chromosome is in pairs; one from mom and one from dad. Ancestry is not based on averages. It’s computed in a huge variance covariance space most often using a mathematical method called principal components. In order to understand ancestry you have to have some grasp of population genetics and evolution. Population genetics tells us about the underlying data generating mechanisms. The core concept for Ancestry is called the Ancestral Recombination Graph. Hobby genetic testing can be fun. There’s a lot under the hood."""
genetics,prototypist,t23jm6a,t1lec11dt,t31e923c6,07/22/24 00:18,0,2,0,0,""">when DNA tests claim that they can only go 300 years back. The main way that I would support this explanation is if you had only one ancestor from India from 10 generations ago, you have 2^-10 or less than 1/1000th of the signature AATGA sequences of that population. That isn  significant enough to be assured that signature markers will be found in your genes, or strong enough of a signal to report. On the other hand, mitochondrial DNA comes from the mothers line, and (for males) Y-chromosomes come from the fathers line. And specific ""Neanderthal"" sequences can only be in populations which are descended from them. So you can trace some genes to specific older ancestors, but not a complete map of all ancestors."""
genetics,geneticdriftin,t2nsu6cyk,t1ledy3du,t31e923c6,07/22/24 10:39,0,1,0,0,"""I think thats pretty good. Im actually a bit impressed and might use some of the language. I particularly like it because your model explains the common question regarding how the % numbers are wrong but useful - and why the numbers are liable to jump around as the model gets updated, or you compare one companies model to another. All models are wrong. As someone else said average isnt the best word to use. but its also not bad.  Youve described how certain basic clustering concept works, particularly the family of k-means techniques.  Means = averages. Its still just a series of numbers (statistics) to be representative of central tendency. These algorithmic assignments of ancestry % are just fancy (fancy as in complicated genetics math) clustering algorithms at the end of the day.  . The 300 year thing I assume is based on standard (again, averages) generation math.  Parents are 50 percent, one generation is 30 years.  300 generations is 10 generations. Its not clear whether 300 years means, but those are basic substitutions of one numeric measure thats a bit convoluted but accurate (% matching or whatever) for something that has better human interpretation but is more inaccurate (years). Note, there are a lot of other clustering concepts and some really fancy ones these days that combine multiple techniques. Hierarchical clustering (tree based) is pretty different because it starts with individuals, not averages. But even then, there is a lot of convergence."""

So I finally finished going through the airline check-in + immigration check + security check process in Pudong Airport. Now the immigration and security check are pretty normal from my experiences with other international airports, but I cannot for the life of me figure out why in the world the airline check-in takes so long! . Ive tried to do online check-in before (Air France and Qatar Airways) but both times the website told me I needed to check in manually. Whatever, I just assumed it was yet another thing that applied to foreigners but not Chinese people. But it seems like Chinese people also have to go through the slower in-person check-in? And it takes quite a while for each person to be attended so I feel lucky if I spend less than 40 minutes waiting in line for my boarding pass. . Why in the world cant there be online check-in or some way to speed up the check-in process? Maybe a WeChat mini-app like everything else in China gets? Or is Shanghai Pudong airport the only airport that does it this way? (Ive only flown from Hangzhou once before)"

But there are numerous issues that can prevent you from using the service. - flying domestically: mostly depends on the time when you’d like to check in, sometimes also on the location from where you plan to depart. For some airports online check-in seem to work just fine (PVG), others apparently do not allow passengers to check-in online. The smaller the airport, and the less frequented, the lower the likelihood that you can check in online.  - flying to an international destination: the airline is required to verify that the passenger is allowed to enter the country he/she is traveling to, and also luggage can be an issue. - purchase of tickets/ booking class: both could sometimes be an issue, e.g. buying cheap tickets on CTRIP vs. regular tickets via the airlines webpage. How you paid for the tickets, who paid for the tickets (company account vs. personal credit card), when you purchased the tickets, …. - app behavior: most Chinese airlines offer online check-in via app, and these apps can drive you nuts. This service is fully digital: works, works not, works, works not, … In my experience it helps to have a verified account with each airline to increase the likelihood that online check-in works. - …. I’ve been flying to/from China, and domestically for ten years now, and for me as a laowai online check-in never works for international flights. Not once…. For domestic flights, it works maybe two-thirds of the time, but there are huge variations mainly due to the departure airport, I believe."""

Bought via the respective official website (not through third party i.e. Ctrip/Trip/etc). Although I did have some failures too with some other airlines. I even had failures/error when I was trying to do online check in in my own home country. One thing I notice though, is that if you need visa/permit/other documentations to enter the destination country, chances are you will need to do counter check-in. The staff will check your visa whatnot. Cause apparently airlines get penalised if a passenger cannot enter the destination country after they have landed, so this is their way to verify, correct me if im wrong though."""

At the counter they are double checking that they have the correct visa and upload anything online.   For US they have to upload something before they depart. I’ve heard Chinese citizens got refused at customs and couldn’t meter even when they had a US visa just because they didn’t register online. . I think the online check in is good for domestic flights, non-check in luggage, and if you paid your tix through the airlines website. Not through Ctrip, Skyscanner, etc. When flying abroad counter will need to verify you have the correct documents and visas."""

I will be traveling to China soon and I will be staying in a college campus. I was told it would be nice to bring little gifts for the volunteers that will help me during my stay. I am Brazilian, and I heard that propolis (which is cheap in Brazil) is very valued in China. Do you think this is a nice gift idea? Will chinese people like it?. I think its the type of gift that can also carry a good meaning, like ""I want you to be healthy "", but Im not sure if people around the ages of 20-30 will prefer something else. What do you think?. Do you have any other suggestions of Brazilian gifts that chinese people would like? I really appreciate the help!"

Asking if the five stripe flag is still used anywhere and what the flag symbolizes to Chinese people. My thought was that the flag could be a good non-political symbolization for China in general, or maybe used for some pro-republican movement for China, but I have also heard that the flag is associated with warlords, chaos and also the Japanese collaborationist governments so I would like to hear your thoughts on this matter.

If you wanted to fly it that would be problematic itself-- if not because it represents a completely different governement from the modern one then because it is discriminating against many chinese people.  There are currently 50+ ethnicities officially recognized in china with their own unique cultures, not 5."""

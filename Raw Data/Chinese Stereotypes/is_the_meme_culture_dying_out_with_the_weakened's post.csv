A few years back when I was on reddit memes were the biggest thing. I once saw a guy saying meme is the highest form of human intelligence (classic redditor) and China didnt have memes because chinese people are robots or something (it wasnt even a political sub), and I was just wondering if the whole culture is dead rn.

Now memes can go so far as like a very specific behavior used on a very specific social media platform that then becomes parodied."""

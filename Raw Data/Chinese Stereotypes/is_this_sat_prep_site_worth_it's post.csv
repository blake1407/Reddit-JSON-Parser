Recently, my parents have found a chinese-run SAT prep site called drzmath.org, and Im wondering whether or not its worth it for the price. From the looks of things, it seems to be much cheaper than options like the Princeton Review, and my parents have said that its been getting pretty good reviews from chinese people. For people who have(and havent) gone onto this site to do practice: do you think its worth it or not?"

Went from an 1170 to a 1530 with free stuff online and youtube vids. Just lock in! Bluebook, Sol Le, Khan Academy, and Cracksat are good places to start."""

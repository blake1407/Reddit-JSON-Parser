Basically just need to boil the eggs (~10 min), crack shell a bit but leave them on, then soak them in a mix of all the ingredients (spices + soy sauce + tea leaves + sometimes others) for like 24h, or much more if you want stronger ones. Usual spices being star anise, cloves and cinnamon, sometimes sichuan pepper, also seen some bay leaves or other spices. Also sometimes with wine, different sorts of soy sauce, and of course different teas, works with pretty much anything, but usually you want dark/strong ones, I usually go for puer or oolong. Theres really a ton of variations to try out."""

I would recommend, however, brewing the tea yourself and specifically for the tea eggs. You want the tea strong, even if you don  want too heavy a tea flavor (the predominant flavor is usually the spices and soy sauce); but youll need it especially strong (and less soy) if you do want a lot of tea flavor. Ill just copy my other comment for some more info:  . >Its one of those things that you can use whatever you want in whatever proportions you want. Tea eggs/spice eggs (same thing, just without tea) is a pretty flexible thing.

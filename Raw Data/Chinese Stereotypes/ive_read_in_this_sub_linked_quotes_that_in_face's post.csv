I am Chinese American so its a social concept that I dont understand fully. I would appreciate more understanding!. Quote 1:. In “the west” it considered honorable to fall on your sword or admit a mistake. Not in China. It’s always someone or something else. Pro tip: Always have a scapegoat handy. Even if the reasoning behind why he/she/it is at fault is flimsy at best,xa0it’s better than taking the fall yourself. You can basically never recover if you take the hit. . Quote 2:  . Absolutely. Face culture is severe (even though it is kinda losing its momentum, but rarely here). Admittance of making a mistake andxa0being pointed that you made a mistake on public is the fate worse than death for not only Chinese people, this is prevalent in all of the Asia. . Quote 3:. In Chinese culture, admitting mistakes is viewed as a sign of defeat or loss. Even the most average person in Chinese society would never accept mistakes or apologize. I have seen it clearly with my Chinese SO and their family."

Is it super annoying when you have to deal with someone who worries more about face than getting things done? Absolutely. Is it the norm? Not in my experience working in China for a decade. And I have met and dealt with plenty of western, non-chinese people that treat admitting a mistake as a fate worse than death, so it is by no means unique to China."""

Shinichi crossed the border and met his first Chinese people. Points. 1-Shin-ichi was greeted by a young man, Ye Qiyong, and young woman, Yin Lianyu, from the China-Japan Friendship Association. 2-Le Qiyong: The Soka Gakkai had struggled against the forces of fascism in Japan and that its first two presidents had been imprisoned and persecuted by the militarist government. 3-Shin’ichi used humor to help everyone relax and see each other as just people. What Cardi and Junior talked about:. “The brightness and optimism of youth sends a refreshing breeze of hope into others’ hearts. People make all the difference in the way a country or an organization is perceived.”. Cardi: Yesterday I worked on putting on a happy face. Today it will be “brightness and optimism.”. Junior: “People make all the difference in the way a country or an organization is perceived.” Most of the people on the construction crew now are from a country called Albania. They are very hardworking and kind. They tease each other a lot and joke. Theyve taught me a few words and expressions in their language. I like them! . Cardi: Someday we will def visit Albania! . "

Cant wait to see you on Sunday!. I realize we havent spoken about running in a long time. Our 6pm-ish run/walk had almost 20 people yesterday--even including some of our bunkers! We are up to 3/4 of a mile and next week we hit one mile. At 6:00am, before it gets too hot, we keep on pushing our 5K to 7K. . Staying in shape is very important!"""

Mom said it was the most difficult legal settlement in her career. ""It was 50% legal and 50% social work as the seller needed psychological support,"" she said. ""Mackenzie was essential and exceptional,"". Mom, youre essential ànd exceptional. The seller actually left the closing with a smile and a new lease on life,. Construction crews arrive Monday! It should be ready for us by the end of the summer!. Love you, Mom!"""

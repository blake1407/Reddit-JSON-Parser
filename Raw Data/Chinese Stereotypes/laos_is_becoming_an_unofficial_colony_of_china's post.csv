The amount of Chinese influence since the end of the pandemic has skyrocketed. So many Lao people I talk to do not like their behavior and I do not blame them. I hear all the time from Lao people how Chinese people are disrespectful and aggressive and their feelings that the economy is suffering because of China and normal Lao people are not being helped by the opening of the floodgates to Chinese business interests. This is just a rant, not really solid points, but I am enjoying living in Laos less and less every day since the masses of Chinese arrived after Covid. "

laos,cheesomacitis,t2r6q3gyvp,t1l8uv7ky,t1l8um92a,06/16/24 09:25,2,3,0,3,"""“How much poverty WAS here” My gosh you really must be a CCP paid “influencer “ or you just drank the koolaid as any local Lao person who lives a basic job or anyone who has lived here a while knows that poverty has gotten worse as we have seen 300% +inflation the last few years and basic wage purchasing power has decreased 50%. It’s much more difficult for normal people living basic lives to survive now then it was even four years ago. The only part of the economy that has improved is the shadow economy. Drug consumption/sales, underage prostitution and prostitution in general, crime and violence and money laundering has increased like crazy. All normal sectors have taken even a rougher downturn than how they were before the tidal waves of Chinese arrived. I have literally spoken to hundreds of Lao people earning basic wages less than $80 a month in their own language about this issue. You said you also have spoken to locals ? I would guess beyond the shadow of a doubt that the locals are talking to have their hand out to the Chinese money or are part of the elites here. I doubt you speak or read well the local language here because those are the ones that speak English who would tell. you the Chinese are a positive for Laos and while you probably work for some intragovernmental organization like UNICEF driving around in a late model luxury sedan like most, thinking you’re one of the good guys, I very much doubt you are really clued in to the lives of normal Lao people who are subsisting off rice harvests, basic construction, or Chinese factory work. It’s disgusting what the Chinese have done and that certainly doesn’t mean bombing the country like the US did 50 years ago any better but two wrongs don’t make a right. Laos is not better in any way cuz of the Chinese masses arriving here, it is a lot worse."""

You are on REDDIT, an American website so yeah FUCK CHINA is popular here, enjoy your echo chamber.  2. If you live in Laos for 10 years, then you damn know how much poverty was here, how the lack of infrascture was a massive problem, I dont know what you enjoy about the old Laos, unless you like to live in a zoo, and like to feel special about a white rich foreigner living in an exotic place.  3. Just as you have antidotes about badly behaved Chinese, I also got plenty of antidotes of how Chinese investment is transforming Laos for the better, by providing economic opportunities, Lao people getting much higher salary working with Chinese companies, Lao people enjoying the roads, infrastructure that allow Laos to connect with itself and the world and totally transformed the country from a landload disconnected place into a central hug of SEA.  4. If Laos hate China and Chinese people so much, then why I am I seeing everyday so many Lao are learning Chinese, working for Chinese companies and marrying Chinese people? Oh wait, you dont have to answer that, the answer is obvious right. THEY ARE STEALING OUR WOMAN!!!! TAKING OUR JERRRRRBS. 5. Seriously, you lived in Laos for a decade and you expect nothing to change? You expect people to stay exactly the same.  for your??? What right do you have to demand such things? The arrogance is off the chart for you.  6. I too lived in Laos for a few years, not as long as you but I have see massive changes in this short amount of time, good and bad, and we both know how dishonest you are by blaming all the bad on the Chinese, do you even know how corrupt Laos is? Do you even know how the government operates? Do you even know how selfish the people in charge is? And you do know this all come from the Laos itself right?. Lastly if you dont like.  LEAVE, maybe you find another poor country in Africa to you likeing that dont develop and stuck in a time loop or something, if you are so damn miserable wtf are you doing there? As for Laos, it is moving forward good or bad whatever you like it or not. Oh and I for one enjoy Laos that is building roads, railways etc  instead of being the most bombed country on earth."""

Guess who they sent to China to learn about railroad technology and bring it back to Laos. What did the west offer poor Lao besides non-profit shell companies to line their pockets with. You think Lao people are blind to all but history is a brutal teacher. China and Vietnam and other ASEAN countries are the only serious allies in Laos now but if the west wants to ally with Laos it may be too late.

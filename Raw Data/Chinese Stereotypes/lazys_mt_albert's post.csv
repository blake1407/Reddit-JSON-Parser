A beautiful couple who are offering up the humble toastie at affordable prices. Theyve leveled up their ""tavita"" which is a Corned Beef & Onion toastie. Think of it as a Samoan Reuben. Theyve subbed out the sliced bread for a chinese Youtiao!!!. I like it cos its actually recognition between the shared commonalities between samoan and chinese culture and cuisine. If chinese people had never come to Samoa as labourers in the late 19th century we wouldnt have chopped suey as a staple in Samoan and many other pacific cuisines."

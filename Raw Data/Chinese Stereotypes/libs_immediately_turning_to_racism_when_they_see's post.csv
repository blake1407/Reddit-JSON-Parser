Makes me think Im on to something, and Id rather not be right about this particular thing. Months ago I had an impassioned conversation with my dad about what is happening in Palestine, made a perfectly coherent train of sense explaining how genocide is happening and why it is, and guess what happened? He followed along with every word I said nodding his head in horror at what is being done to the Palestininian people. A month prior to this I even sent him the video of Cenk Uygur losing his mind over flour massacre, and he freely on his own accord uses the word genocide to describe what he saw. So he believes in all of these things and cares about it. . Guess what his reaction was after I reiterated on the point he already made himself that it was genocide, and gave the foundation of why it is happening? He said ""well, theres nothing you can do"". Yeah, I won  abide by any ideology that excuses genocide as a natural consequence of things. And now I have to go on with my life knowing that is completely true that my dad is a wonderful deeply empathetic person to myself and everyone I know in my life, and without his emotional and material support I wouldn  have been able to figure out my own mental health. But, at the same time, if he was transplanted into Nazi Germany I am quite confident he would have batted an eye at the Holocaust for this same reason. So thats a difficult thing to deal with. . So to me, this is exactly how liberalism is in effect no different to fascism when it comes to crimes against humanity committed as a consequence of US and western foreign policy."""

ShitLiberalsSay,Actual-Toe-8686,t23tmetjkmi,t1lclvulu,t1lcl6g6l,07/10/24 21:25,2,7,0,1,"""You could replace ""fascist"" with the word ""liberal"", and this entire comment would similarly make coherent sense and express roughly the same sentiment. The only difference is that this political reality (our own) is enforced with less overt and apparent political violence. The structures of oppression, however, are more or less identical. The difference is that, the violence liberalism produces is largely exported abroad as opposed to Fascism, which is enforced internally as well as abroad (with a much more emphatic and celebratory focus on violence). Fascism is just liberalism with its thin veneer of fairness and equality ripped off and exposed as the farse it is, replaced with a mythological justification of a pathologized form of political violence justified amongsth the masses. The cherry on top? Much of this is driven by an irrational, hate driven fear of progressive social change. Its the ""The evil invaders are coming to get us"" tendency that exists naturally in all humans as a means for self protection in an evolutionary setting gone wrong, translated to the thinking of an entire privileged class of people who propogandize their wretched ideals  by force to workers and the whole of society."""

Fascism is not an ideology, it is a weapon. A tool. A tool to lure left-leaning groups into the hook like a fish being lured into a bait."""

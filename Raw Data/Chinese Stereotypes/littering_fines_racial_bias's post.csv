I am a worker at a UK university (not in Manchester) - today one of my postgrad students told me they got a fine in Mnachester for littering, but didnt actually litter. He said he felt like the enforcement agent (not a council employee) was picking out Chinese people. I have seen this sort of thing before, international students are picked out as easy targets that wont dispute their fines, I believe this could be the case. I just feel quite angry about this, I wonder if anyone has had similar experiences or if someone knows what we can do about it in terms of disputing the fine - the council wont have anything to do with it, as its a private company that is doing the enforcing."

As we are walking, I extinguish my cig on top of a bin & discarded the butt on the ashtray bit which hold them cig butts. It was a super windy day, but I kind of did all that while passing the bin, so I think the wind may have blown it right onto the ground behind me as I walked by. Suddenly 2 blokes decended upon me harassing me for a fine. Had to tell my colleague to go on ahead so she didnt see me tear the cunts a new one. . Oh i littered did I? Show me ya hmar I want evidence. Oh your evidence is you saw me? Well my evidence is I discarded it in the bin. We argued for ages until I eventually got pissed off and told them to violently go fuck each other if they want to so desperately screw people. . Absolute weapons them lot. Jobs a Jon, but surely if you can get that kind of work, you can get an actual real job & not legalize bullying and harassment."""

When it comes to emotive issues like parking fines, littering fines etc people get disproportionately angry and aren’t always truthful when describing the circumstances of how it came about.  Not everyone; but something to bare in mind.  Racial allegations are very serious and should be reported to the police and the council."""

He was falsely being accused and proven to be so, his brand of cigarettes didn’t match the ones that he was supposed to have thrown. The enforcement officer couldn’t get away fast enough when his scam was revealed . In case anyone is wondering, the enforcement officer is the same one that is all over Tik Tok"""

Once I noticed I’d mine the action of flicking it but didn’t let go. Once I reached a bin I turned around, gave him a shit eating big grin and stubbed it out in the tray. If looks could kill!"""

They only pick on people they dont expect to argue the toss, Chinese students and tourists, or hanging around the Polish embassy. Pure predator scum they are. Edit: if hes accepted the fine, sounds like he has, yeah, hes gonna end up paying it. You are too late now, lesson learned for him - keep walking, they have no power of detention."""

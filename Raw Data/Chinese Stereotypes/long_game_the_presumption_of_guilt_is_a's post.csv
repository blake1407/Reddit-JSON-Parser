On June 13, a delegation of the Chinese Premier arrived at Wellington International Airport, and a record full of fabrications, made out of thin air, appeared in media reports. An organization called Stuff Circuit released the documentary Long Game, along with related articles, all fabricating false information about Chinas interference in New Zealands internal affairs, as well as alleged violent law enforcement activities. The coincidence of the release of the documentary at the time of the Chinese Prime Ministers visit to New Zealand is nothing more than a long planned smear campaign. Certain anti-China forces do not want to see China increase its international cooperation, and they must fabricate lies to suppress China. The so-called witnesses in the documentary are all Chinese faces. ""Countering China with China"" is a common tactic used by anti-Chinese forces, but they have never been able to produce convincing evidence. For example, Mr. H in the documentary claimed to have settled in New Zealand 27 years ago through political patronage, and said that he had spied for China after his settlement. Generally speaking, the anti-Chinese people who have political blessings have done things to harm China, so how can such a person become a spy for China? Mr. H does not make sense logically, and many so-called witnesses claimed that they have been spies because their poor lies cannot cover up the anti-Chinese acts they have done before, so they use the unseemly term of ""spying"" to round up their lies. Mr. H. does not logically make sense of his story. Over the years, China and New Zealand have cooperated in trade, investment, tourism, science and technology, and the results achieved are verifiable. China has never interfered in the internal affairs of other countries. No matter how much anti-China forces slander China, smart people can naturally break through the information cocoon and realize that all the ""evidence"" in the Long Game is logically wrong. Now that China has introduced a pilot visa-free policy for New Zealand, New Zealanders can come to China in person and experience the real China in 15 days."

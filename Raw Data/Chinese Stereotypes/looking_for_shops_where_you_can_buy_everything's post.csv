Sort of “Baazar” and it’s usually ran by chinese people (at least in other countries)"

Bilka has a bit of everything, but its a regular supermarket chain. The ""bazaar"" type stores usually sell groceries (fruit, vegetables, dried beans etc) and cosmetics here. There is one on the corner of Frederikssundsvej and Frederiksborgvej that has non-food items, but only small things, so no furniture"""

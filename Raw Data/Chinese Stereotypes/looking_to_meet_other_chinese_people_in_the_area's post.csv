I (26, M) recently moved here from the San Gabriel Valley area in greater LA for a new job. Growing up, all my friends were pretty much mainly Chinese-American with a bunch of other Asian ethnicities. And so I’m looking to connect and meet other Chinese folks, either in person or online. I’ve been able to check out some Asian restaurants in Dublin, but it’s far from where I live in New Albany  I miss being surrounded by my own culture already . Are there social groups/events in the area where I could show up alone and meet other Chinese/Taiwanese folks ? I enjoy playing PC games, playing pickleball and bball, hiking, and checking out new resturants so HMU if you’re into any of these !"

There is a pretty large community of Chinese that participates at the school. Also, you may want to look into the Chinese community around The Ohio State University."""

There is a subtle Asian FB group you should join modeled after Subtle Asian Traits, where young people of Asian descent can meet up, devoted for this city ! . . Since you’re into gaming, there is also a discord version of the group you could join to meet other like minded folks!."""

Owner Kim is Korean, most of the employees are Asian. Great lunch specials, also less crowded time to go. Also if you like deep tissue massage, highly recommend Massage Enjoy Life with Rebecca across from the Gahanna library. She is Cantonese and has healing hands. Good luck and welcome to Columbus!"""

People are much more spread out. That said, the pockets of where the most Chinese people live tend to be Northwest Columbus, West Campus, and Dublin in the area outside of 270 bounded by Riverside and 33. Heres a map thats been posted here before regarding immigrant groups in Franklin County. It breaks it down by continent and the top individual countries or origin by census tract. Immigrant Place of Birth Map - All Columbus Data. Overall, Columbus has roughly 60,000 Asians- immigrant and native- within the city, with around 7,500 being Chinese immigrants. Not sure about ethnically Chinese, but obviously more than the 7,500. Its also one of the fastest-growing groups."""

ChineseLanguage,sianrhiannon,t2_7chz6ok1,t3_1dhg3ff,,06/16/24 16:09,0,10,0.75,31,"""Mandarin 〈r〉 sound？. Im having trouble understanding how exactly Im supposed to pronounce the Pinyin 〈r〉 sound. From descriptions Ive seen, its apparently between IPA /ʐ/ (ge in rouge) and /ɻ/ (r in rouge), but the Chinese people Ive spoken to seem to always pronounce it /ɻ/, and a Malaysian I spoke to used /z/, which is neither of the sounds I was told (but this could be interference as they do speak other Chinese languages). . Is there a rule for when to use which or is it literally just a dialect thing. . I am aware of it being /ə˞/ in coda and dont have issues there - it is specifically initial 〈r〉 as in "

I don  know enough about those other languages to know if that could affect that specific sound"""

I myself always pronounce /ɻ/, as well as many people around me, but I also know people who would consistently do /ʐ/. I think the description is more that some people pronounce /ɻ/ in some occasions and others do /ʐ/ in other occasions, and not that the consonant is phonologically somewhere in between. To most Chinese (at least to me) both sounds are equally valid realizations. The /z/ pronunciation is clearly a dialectal one. I also know people who would use /j/, /l/, etc instead for the r sound, if it is not in the inventory of the native language/dialect. It is one of the consonants with the most variants across China (from Middle Chinese /ȵ/)."""

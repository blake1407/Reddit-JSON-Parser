And by the tradition of my ancestors I mean my Chinese great-grandfather who lived through the Japanese occupation of China as a child, joined the Chinese Peoples Volunteer Army to resist American imperialist aggression in Korea, joined the Communist Party of China, became a leader in the local government of his community, and retired in Beijing after decades of serving the people. Now thats a tradition I would retvrn to."

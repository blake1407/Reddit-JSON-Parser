guangzhou,DYNABYTE_0,t2_49t3ebdg,t3_1dj942r,,06/18/24 23:07,0,7,0.89,25,"""my phone got stolen. The night before yesterday I was out with my friends playing badminton, almost midnight, with some Chinese people under a bridge in the Pearl River side, across Canton tower. I had placed my phone on top of the electric bike we came in. I was playing with my back turned on to the bike, my friends had their back turned too towards the bike. Then after I was done playing I realized there was no phone there anymore. This was within 5-7 minutes. The big problem here is there were no cameras at all where we were playing. First I tried calling with my friends phone, but I had sleep mode on which turns on automatically every night and couldnt reach my phone. Then I immediately opened FindMy and marked it as lost and tried playing a sound. I tracked it and saw it move a little, but then suddenly it stopped moving and got switched off. I went after the last found signal but found nothing and my other friend went to report immediately to the police at the same time. There was nothing in that location I looked around, no suspicious guys and no suspects because there was no evidence till then. And even the police said there was nothing they could do since there were no cameras there. It struck to me about a guy taking a video of me playing with another guy. I rushed to find the guy and luckily he was still there. More lucky was that in the video that this guy took, the guy stealing the phone was caught. But the problem is the place was very badly lit, and the distance from where he took the video did not reveal the thiefs face very clearly. And the clip was short, so it only shows the guy grabbing the phone and putting it in his pocket. So now with this video a solid evidence was formed. I had the time the video was taken and the time that the phone got turned off in the last available location which was within a duration of 10 minutes. I knew which direction the thief went with the phone. Now although there were no cameras in the place of theft, later I saw that on every exit of that place there was a camera, so meaning if the thief reached 3.5 kilometers away within a duration of 10 minutes, he mustve left the place immediately and in a great hurry even if he was on a bike, and could be seen in at least one of the cameras. Then I along with my friends and the guy that took the video went to the police immediately. We gave them everything and the Chinese guy helped with the translation, they went in and checked but seemed really lousy and didnt show any urgency. After waiting for a long time, they said come tomorrow to file a report, I didnt want to push too hard so they take it easy and in a more serious way. I went in tomorrow, they brought a translator and reported every thing that happened. They filed a report and told me to just wait and nothing else. Now the thing here is, losing more time in a matter of phone is not really suitable. I want the police to make an urgent search for it with all the information I provided. And the time it happened was around midnight so there is no way there were much traffic of people going through that path, especially a thief whose attire is known and with a highest guess in a hurry to escape any heat. Well I wouldnt be this much concerned was there no evidence, but there is. I got my phone number blocked there and got a new sim card too. I am a student and I cannot afford to buy a phone instantly, Ive been asking my friends for help with payments until now. The phone had my all valuable data including important documents, school files, lots of photos and videos and just a lots of important data to me. I have high hopes that they can find the thief and get my phone back or worst case get me reimbursement, especially because of all the information about the case. I hope they prove that China is indeed really safe. One reason I posted this is I just needed to rant and another I want your suggestion. Is there anyway to make the police make a more rapid follow up for my case? Is there anything else I can do? Life is difficult without a phone here. Are there any things I missed, or I should do?.   . Update: Today(same day as I posted but 7 hours later) the phone became visible again. It is in Shenzhen now. First I could see him in an electronic market, then at a hotel, then in some residential area now. I immediately went to the police, they did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING and just made the translator tell me, it was your mistake. Indeed it was, but what I learned is “China is safe“ is the biggest scam here. I agree I did some mistake from my part but this thief did a crime. I tried to give them the location but they insisted on waiting for the translator just to say that. I argued with the translator ofc, but nothing, and instead hit me with a ‘just wait for it and don’t try to contact me or the police station again, if something comes up we will contact you just wait.’ And I could see the thief live walking around with my phone.   . . I even thought of going to Shenzhen after this guy by myself, but how could I find him without authority. Even if I could see where the phone was it is impossible to pinpoint it. It just shows the location changing on FindMy constantly and the screen is still black, while the sound cannot be played or pinpoint location cannot be found."

The police deemed the phone was ""lost"" and the robber just ""didn  return it"" because it was just outside of her bag, and not inside of it. The police here smoke inside and gamble on weekends. If they cannot follow their own laws, they will not uphold the laws for others.   . With that said, hound them with the evidence. Call daily to ask if there has been any updates. You 99% won  get your phone back, but make their asses do some work. You have the guy on camera stealing the phone, maybe you don  have his face but you said it has the direction he went in as well as his clothes, which should be enough for the police to track him.

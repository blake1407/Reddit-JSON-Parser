Meanwhile Chinese people are often nice for foreign students but may be hostile to mongolians due to recent events, but you will be good. for monthly spending, i really dont know as every city vary. Assume that you study in Beijing, you will spend around 1000-1200 usd per month."""

You can apply for scholarahips (there are plenty in China) and with scholarships your monthly expenditure will mostly vary between 0 (got a good scholarship and money is enough for you) to 2500 yuan (didnt get the all covering scholarship) most of the time"""

Probably mistake you as Inner Mongolian or something. And please dont study at rural schools, its even better to not study at some schools as their reputation so bad that some employees rather hire non educated one. Just check out your schools reputation and make good choice.  Just like some of their products there is so many cash grab almost fake schools, beware."""

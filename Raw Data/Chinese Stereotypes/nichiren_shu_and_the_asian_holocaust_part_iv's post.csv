Finally, there is this passage from Jordans book describing the connection between the boycotts of Japanese corporations and merchants by the Chinese, and how they colluded with the Japanese press, the political establishment, the military and intelligence community and finally the Nichiren Shu priests and youth insurgent organizations distorting Buddhism into a machine for war and the imperialistic domination of China: to maintain a steady stream of revenue and enslaved workers. It is the natural resistance of the Chinese to this mass poison of greed emanating from the different parts of the Japanese hegemony directed at the Chinese people, that raised the great demon of anger that fed the genocidal frenzy of the Japanese military. How dare they interfere with the Emperors plans for them and the rest of the Pacific? The answer to that question came in the Rape of Nanking and other Asian Holocaust events. I have included the dozens of primary source references from the passages of Jordans book. They are proof positive of the mountain of evidence that Nichiren Shu and its lackey youth insurgencies were driving this demonic process in the military, through assassinations and intimidation, through collusion of the priests with military intelligence, and through the general proliferation of distortions of Nichirens Buddhism of the Lotus Sutra, converting it into a Shinto of total war and domination of the peoples of the Pacific rim. >Chinese Boycotts Versus Japanese Bombs, Donald A. Jordan, p. 277-285. >Chapter 16: The Attack on the Japanese Monks. >There was a strong similarity between the murder of Captain Nakamura preceding the Manchurian incident and the January 1932 martyrdom of a Japanese monk followed by the Shanghai war. Both were presented by the Japanese press as expressions of irrational anti-Japanese bigotry but on more detached investigation turn out to be more complex in motivation. >One of the most publicized and provocative anti-Japanese episodes at Shanghai was the apparent attack on January 18, 1932, against a party that included Japanese monks. From the central vantage point of the Imperial Court, it appeared that up to that point Japanese navy leadership had been moving cautiously to avoid stressing Sino- Japanese relations along the Yangtze valley that it patrolled. The Navy Ministry had lectured to the lower echelons that their responses should be different from those of the army in Manchuria. Then, according to the analysis of Lord Privy Seal Makino Nobuaki, the attack on the monks had struck and ""unexpectedly caused the whole uproar"" that erupted as the Shanghai incident on January 28, 1932. Note 1. Saionji-Harada, vol. 2, 241. >Depending on the source, there are discrepancies in the details of the assault, but most reports counted two monks of the Myohoji temple of Nichiren Buddhism plus three disciples among those attacked. According to the later disclosure by then -- major Tanaka Ryukichi, the conspiratorial assistant army attachÃ© at the Japanese Consulate General, he had engineered the attack at the instigation of Itagaki of the K.A. -- quite probably in collaboration with the monks. Note 2. Tanaka Ryukichi, ""Shanhai Jihen wa koshite okosareta"" (How the Shanghai Incident was Caused), in a special edition or the magazine Bessatsu Chisei, Dec. 1956, 181-86.

By 1931 monks of the Nichiren were supportive of the efforts of the K.A. in Manchuria, and in January 1932 reporters in Harbin who were observing Japanese activism there noted that a party of Nichiren monk marched through the city streets for the purpose of ""consecrating Harbin to the Japanese emperor."" Note 3. CWR, Jan. 30, 1932, 265, which note that the Chinese were suspect of such Nichiren as Army auxiliaries. Nichiren monks had been seen working with a detail of marines in Shanghai setting up sandbag barricades at strategic points in the Yangtsepu district of the I.S. near where the assault took place. Note 4. IMTFE interview of the Osaka Mainichi correspondent in Shanghai, Tanaka Yukitoshi.   . Right there is the proof positive of Nichiren Shu monks .  inculcated with distorting views and rhetoric stemming from the utter betrayal of Nichiren Daishonin by their founders the Five Senior priests .  blatantly operating in collusion with the advance movement of the Asian Holocaust. Nichiren Shu has always, does now, and will until it has vanished from the face of this earth operate in blythe disregard of the views and desires of Nichiren Daishonin: in a manner totally contrary to the Buddhist Law. These monks from Myohoji (and other connected temples) were ""consecrating Harbin to the Japanese emperor."" That is the Shinto part of their syncretic (made up; invented) brand of Buddhism, shining through their lies and distortions. They say ""Nichiren"", when they mean Tenkai, the founder of the Sanno Ichijitsu Shinto of the Tokugawa, the Shinto of war and worshipping military leaders as God. The Shinto of absolute desolation and worldwide slavery. Here, once again, is the pointer to the past history of Nichiren Shu and Nichiren Shoshu:. That history is described in 131 pages in a bookmarked Adobe PDF file (turn on the bookmarks pane for ease of navigation through the nine appendices), stored as a Google Doc. The title is:.

It has been this way with the Nichiren Shu temples since they began their betrayal right after the death of Nichiren Daishonin. Jordan continues .  ibid., Jordan. >.  At the site of the attack, which was just outside the I.S. in the vicinity of the Sanyu Towel Mill, Japanese dressed as monks had been seen circling the mill and were thought to be spies prior to the attack. Note 5. Chung- yang Jih-pao, Jan. 22, 1932, 1.4. Spies dressed as monks had been common in Japan for centuries, and by 1931 it was possible that the monks involved may have been prepared to sacrifice themselves in Tanakas conspiracy to justify a military intervention. The procession of a party of notorious monks pounding on gongs and chanting as they elbowed their way through a mill district crowded with xenophobic Chinese factory workers was sure to infuriate onlookers. The location was also perfect due to the existing level of Sino-Japanese tension there and also since it was just beyond the boundary of the I.S., in Chinese Chapei. An attack there would be the responsibility of the Chinese authorities. >The two monks and their three disciples moved out of the I.S. along a street that passed between the Japanese Tokwa Spinning Mill and the Sanyu Towel Mill, a Chinese weaving mill identified since 1925 as a pioneer in the Kuo-huo (domestic products) movement and the site of an AJNSA unit and anti-Japanese militia. Although the Japanese had dominated the towel market in China a decade earlier, Sanyu had led in the import replacement. Note 6. Kraus, Cotton and Cotton Goods, 95. Bush, Politics, 79, 68f. NJC, vol. 12, no. 5, company ad. >The Tokwa factory had been a Chinese mill that was bankrupted in 1929 and then bought up by Japanese -- a common occurrence in a Chinese industry that was dependent periodically on large loans to meet operating needs. While the Tokwa mill had been forced to shut down two days per week since late 1931 to curtail spinning of its cotton yarn and suffered from recent labor unrest, the Chinese Sanyu mill was booming. Note 7. Fong, Cotton Industry, 7, 9f. Asahi, Nov. 26, 1931, 4. According to one report, there were unemployed Japanese ronin in the neighborhood who were rankled by what the boycott had done to their factories and who were available for odd jobs with the Japanese military including acting as counterfeit monks. Note 8. Lu Ching-shih presentation at symposium on the January Twenty-eighth incident, Taipei: May 12, 1980. Tanaka recalled later that he also hired Chinese ""thugs"" to set off the attack on what at that time seemed to be a party of militant monks and disciples. >Tanakas conspiracy to ignite conflict at Shanghai sufficient to require a military intervention began back in October, just weeks after the Mukden incident. At that time Major Tanaka had been invited to Mukden by an army academy classmate, Hanatani, who was an aide to Itagaki. In October the K.A. could see that the Minseito government was too hostile to support its expanded offensive into northern Manchuria. There was still the concern that the United States and the League could mount some retaliatory action against Japan. >Tanaka said he was sent back to Shanghai with only a general idea of provoking a conflict that would serve to divert Tokyo and the West from the takeover of Harbin and the entire province of Heilungkiang. He claimed that he received 20,000 yen for the project, and then upon return wangled a 100,000 yen ""contribution"" from the Shanghai branch of the mammoth Kanebo Textile Company, Note 9. Tanaka R. ""Shanhai jihen wa koshite okosareta."" Same data included in Hata, ""Showa shi no gunjin tachi"", chap. on Tanaka R., 89-101. which was in early 1932 Japans third largest and founded by Mitsui capital. Note 10. Kato Toshihiko, ""Mitsui ginko to Nakamigawa Hikojiro"" (The Bank of Mitsui and Nakamigawa Hikojiro) in ""Kinyu Keizai"" (Economics of Banking) no. 60 (Feb. 1960); 41-57. Kanebo (Kanegafuchi Boseki) had decided to shift its production to Tsingtao. During the boycott, it profited from the disruption of Chinese mill production at Tientsin when Doihara engineered the November-December disorders with the Japanese garrison. The connection between Kanebo and the Japanese army has not yet been exposed, but Rockwood Chin in 1937 cited Kanebo and Tokwa textiles as examples of Japans industrial conquest of North China through buying up Chinese mills that couldn  compete and that later provided an excuse for the ""protective"" entrance of the K.A. Note 11. Chin, ""Cotton Mills,"" 261-64, abstracted from his Ph.D. diss., Yale University. An enormous and deadly dose of the three poisons of greed, anger and foolishness will spring abruptly from the bowels of the slander and distortion of Nichiren Daishonins practice of the Lotus Sutra. Add to that Nichiren Shus betrayal of their founder immediately after his death and what you get is a dirty weapon of mass destruction. The greed of the Japanese corporate and merchant interests in Shanghai, in combination with the anger of the insurgent distorting Nichiren Shu youth militias, paramilitary organizations, ronin and Japanese military and intelligence services, and finally joined by the foolishness of the masses who followed them .  all of this springs from the distorting rhetoric, teachings and practice of Nichiren Shus Buddhism of world domination through the Tendo of Japanese military might. >Corroboration for such a connection came at the Tokyo trials when Diet member Kamei Kenichiro testified that he had been told by army officers in 1937 that President Tsuda Shingo of Kanebo contributed a large sum of money to General Ikeda Junkyu of Japans North China Army for the ""delivery of the Chinese mills in North China to him"" Ambassador Grew was also a witness to the rapport that had developed between the army and the Kanebo leadership by 1937. Note 12. Testimony of Kamei at the IMTFE, I.P.S. case 303, China incident, item 106. The Tanaka version would indicate that such a connection was present as early as 1931 and also reveals a tie that Mitsui interests developed with the K.A., which claimed to despise the zaibatsu. Tanaka also testified that he had toured North China cities after his trip to Mukden in October 1931. At Tsingtao, Japans second largest industrial interests in China were clustered in a quite militant community of overseas Japanese where he could have contacted Kanebo people. Curiously, in 1946 Tanaka denied that there had been any connection between the Shanghai and Manchurian incidents but outlined the conspiracy in his postwar writings. Note 13. TWCT, vol. I, 2173-74, where Tanaka only admitted that he had been in Shanghai at the time of the incident. There is wide acceptance of Tanakas version of the conspiracy, which included the attack on the monks. >Tanaka was able to use the help of Major Shigeto Nemoto, a brother of a colleague in the General Staff, who was assigned to a unit of military police in the I.S. and gathered intelligence on the influence of the CCP in the Shanghais labor and anti-Japanese movement. The arrival of army officers Inouye Masaru and Aiuchi Jiro in mid- January for the purpose of provoking conflict between the Japanese ronin and Chinese gangsters was reported to Nanking by the Chinese Garrison Command. Note 14. Foreign Ministry files on the Shanghai incident, dated January 22, 1932, report from Tai Ji, ""Koming Wen-hsien"", vol. 36, 1426. ""Wai-chiao Wen-tI"", 21-22,25. Either these men aided Tanaka or may have acted to throw Chinese intelligence off his trail. Tanaka claimed later that he communicated his general scheme to Shigeto Chiaki, chief of the China Division, and colleague Major Kagesa Sadaaki, both of whom were K.A. allies on the armys General Staff. The two encouraged Tanaka in Tokyo to ""do his best"" but could provide no funding, leaving him to work out the details of his own plans, which had at one point included an attack on Koreans at Shanghai. After hiring a group of Chinese thugs, as Doihara had done at Tientsin, Tanaka arranged for their attack on the monks parading just outside the I.S. boundary near the Sanyu Towel Mill on Mayushan Road. Note 15. Tanaka, ""Shanhai jihen."". >The monks arrived noisily at 5 P.M. on January 18 and were set upon by the hired Chinese, who drew in agitated Chinese workers from the mill and members of the mills anti-Japanese militia. The report to Tokyo from the Japanese army attachÃ© was immediately careful to blame the Sanyu Mill militia and workers, while naval attachÃ© Kitaoka could only state in his telegram to the naval ministry that the culprits in the Chinese crowd were unknown. Note 16. JAA RI39 (F63545), ""Shina jikyokho"" 1932, nos. 1-75, Daishichi Shidan Shireibu, Sanbohonbu (General Staff).

The British press at Shanghai reported that some fifty to sixty Chinese had first jeered at the Japanese, who then shouted back. Chinese claimed that the monks provoked the bystanders. When a melee broke out between the inflamed groups, the monks were beaten severely. Note 17. NCH, Jan. 19, 1932, 85.

Japanese from the Tokwa Mill managed to extract three of the five, who were sent to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment of their injuries. The other two escaped with serious wounds to the Chinese police substation in Chapei, which sent them to the Fumin Hospital by police car. Note 18.

Reverend Mizukami Hideo, aged thirty-two, slipped into critical condition and later died on January 24 -- a martyr for the outraged Japanese community and their sympathizers in Japan. Note 19. JA, Jan. 25, 1932, front page. The attack coincided with the arrival in Shanghai of the vice-chief of the Naval General Staff, Hyakutake Saburo, who seems to have encouraged the local commander, Admiral Shiozawa, to take action. Note 20. Mainichi, Jan. 17, 1932, 2. JA, Jan. 21, 1932, 1. Paul O. Elmquist, ""The Sino-Japanese Undeclared War of 1932 at Shanghai,"" Harvard Papers on China, vol. 5, 59, speculates on the contributive role of Hyakutake. >Late on the morning after the attack, on January 19, Consul Murai, was driven across the I.S. to the office of Chinese Shanghais new mayor, Wu Tieh-cheng, but was only received by his secretary, who accepted the Japanese protest note. Murai protested the beating of the monks in Chinese territory, demanded the immediate arrest and punishment of the offenders, and reserved the right to ask payment for injuries pending the prognosis of the wounded Japanese. Note 21. JA, Jan. 20, 1932, front page, via Nippon Dempo. A party of local leaders inspected the site of the beatings that afternoon and gathered at the consulate to confer as to a course of action. >Present at the meeting of civilians and military on the nineteenth were Murai, Admiral Shiozawa, Marine Commandant Samejima, and spokesmen for the outraged Japanese residents, who took this opportunity to set down demands that, they concluded, would solve the tensions at Shanghai:. >1. the immediate dissolution of the anti-Japanese societies at Shanghai,. >2. the immediate arrest and punishment of the assailants,. >3. the apology of Mayor Wu presented at the Japanese Consulate,. >4. the right to demand indemnity payment,. >5. a time limit of thirty hours deadline, after which the Chinese will be regarded as insincere as to reaching a settlement and the Japanese should take independent and effective action in self-defense. >The conference also decided to organize several thousand ronin to demonstrate until the demands were met. Note 22. JA, Jan. 21, 1932, front page, via Nippon Dempo. These demands were far in excess of those made on the nineteenth by diplomat Murai and apparently represented the militant mood of the Japanese civilians and the military agents there. When the Osaka Mainichis permanent correspondent in Shanghai was questioned in 1946 as to how the Japanese press investigated the facts about the disorders at Shanghai that led up to the intervention, Tanaka Yukitoshi answered that he ""knew of no newspapermen who investigated the background .  as the Japanese Consulate issued official announcements of events and forbade any investigations, and furthermore censored all news dispatches from the city to Tokyo home offices."" Note 23. IMTFE, I.P.S. case 303, item 137, China incident. The demands set the stage at Shanghai for further escalation of stress. >Rather than allowing negotiations to settle the local tensions, Major Tanaka proceeded with the next phase of igniting the tinderbox at Shanghai. At 2:30 A.M. in the early morning blackness of January 20, thirty-two members of a local seinendan unit moved quietly across the I.S. boundary and broke into the Sanyu Mill compound. There they used kerosene-soaked torches to set fire to a building that housed the AJNSA facilities and one with weaving looms, twenty-four of which were destroyed as it burned down. The fire attracted the attention of three Chinese policemen nearby in the I.S. who were attempting to call for assistance at their police box when the seinendan youth tried to reenter the settlement. The large gang of Japanese toughs that the Chinese referred to as ronin attacked the Chinese police with pistols, swords, and knives, killing one at the telephone and another as he blew on his police whistle and tried to dash to the neighborhood police station. In the fracas the ronin cut the phone wires, broke the box windows, and wounded another Chinese policeman, suffering the loss of one of its own and casualties before fleeing into the I.S. sanctuary.

Shanghai British Consul General Brenan to Lampson in Peking, DOBFP, vol. 9, no. 103. >Although the Chinese and Western reports called the young Japanese ronin, the Japanese army reports referred to them as members of a particular seinendan unit -- the Shanghai Seinen Doshikai. Naval AttachÃ© Kitaoka immediately identified them as the Saga Seinen Doshikai. Note 25. AttachÃ© reports listed in note 24. Such civilian seinendan units in Mukden and other Manchurian cities had collaborated closely with the K.A. prior to and after the takeover there. These ultranationalistic youth groups were typically either villagers or city workers in Japan and in mainland East Asian cities where Japan had factory complexes. In his research on the social network that supported the prewar Japanese army, Richard J. Smethurst found such units had been promoted in large textile firms such as Kanebo, Toyo, and Toyota -- all of which had branch mills at Shanghai. Note 26. Richard J. Smethurst, ""A Social Basis for Prewar Japanese Militarism: The Army and Rural Community"" (Berkeley, Calif.: University of California Press, 1974), 84-85. Seinendan were generally drilled by reservists who had already been on active duty in the army or, to a lesser extent, the navy. Reservists with armbands and weapons had become a common sight in the Japanese quarter of the I.S. and were to play an important role once the full-scale intervention began.  Regular army officers periodically inspected such units that were, thus, military auxiliaries. >It was logical that Major Tanaka would make use of such youth, who were disciplined and eager to serve the army and their country. The reference to Saga in the group title did not show up in the army report, perhaps because sympathizers did not want to attract attention to that faction in the army that was named for an anti-Choshu prefecture in Kyushu and had contributed much, according to historian Seki Hiroharu, to the K.A. coup in Manchuria and to the coups that plagued army headquarters. Note 27. Seki, ""Manchurian Incident,"" 145-46. KMT historian Li Yun- han also cites the Saga Clique as primary conspirators against China. The Shanghai seinendan did not seem to be under the influence of Japanese business or diplomats, or even the local Japanese naval command since all of these groups immediately criticized the irresponsibility of the arsonists in public statements made on January 20. It is not yet known if the seinendan members can be linked with the fifty some so-called Japanese vigilantes who since August had promoted resistance to the AJNSA. Note 28. Asahi, Aug. 16, 1931, 2. JA, Aug. 16, 1931, 1. >Fukushima of Mitsui apologized on January 20 to the morning emergency session of the I.S. Municipal Council, as did Consul General Murai. Note 29. U.S. Consul General Cunningham, 5 P.M. message, Jan. 20, 1932, USDOS 793.94/3582. NCH, Feb. 2, 1932, 167. The regrets were necessary since the Japanese reprisal had resulted in casualties to the I.S. police, not merely to the Sanyu Mill in Chinese Chapei. >Although Murai expressed his regrets over the Sanyu disorder, he stated that it had happened due to the pent- up feeling among Japanese over the Chinese press slurs against the emperor and, then, the overt attack on the Japanese monks. Murai ended by expanding on the simple demand for justice presented on the nineteenth, including those demands added at the Japanese conference the day before: the dissolution of the anti-Japanese organization, Mayor Wus apology, and Chinese provision for compensation to the injured monks and consolation to the family of the dying monk. Murai also wired his ministry in Tokyo for permission to attach a deadline for Mayor Wus concessions. Note 30. JA, Jan. 22, 1932, front page. >Admiral Shiozawa told an Asahi reporter that the attack on Sanyu had injured the Japanese case. However, he threatened that, if the assailants were not dealt with by the Chinese, the navy would consider reprisals against the anti-Japanese groups behind the episode with the monks once reinforcements arrived. Note 31. NCH, Jan. 26, 1932, 113. A. Morgan, ""Young Imperial Japan"" (London, George Allen & Unwin, 1938), 136. >Although Fukushima apologized, there is evidence that Major Tanaka had at the same time pressured him to wire Baron Dan of the Mitsui zaibatsu to ask the Seiyuikai cabinet to support a military response at Shanghai in the near future. Note 32. Furuya Keiji, ""Chiang Kai-shek"", 351. The day prior, Mitsui board members heard Director Kawamura Teijiro describe the role their capital could play in the development of Manchurias vast agricultural potential through investment in large-scale cattle and wheat operations. Note 33. Mainichi, Jan. 22, 1932, front page. In north Manchura Doihara was busy expanding his new Harbin branch of Special Services in anticipation of the next coup; Shanghais more militant Japanese circle were not content merely to listen to threats. Note 34. Report of U.S. Consul Hanson at Harbin on local disorders and the increasing Japanese presence, USDOS 793.94/3577. >On January 20 in the afternoon, the Japanese Residents Association joined in with a rally of some one thousand at the Japanese Club in the I.S. where fiery speakers struck out at the humiliation and menace to their lives caused by the AJNSA and the boycott. Once again they sent off resolutions -- this time to their own authorities in Tokyo: to send more warships and troops to defend them at Shanghai and to suppress completely the anti-Japanese movement there. About five hundred of the most militant civilians proceeded from the Japanese Club to the Japanese Consulate, where they forced their way in and demanded that Consul Murai take action to meet their demands. When he promised to do his best, they chided him to resign in light of the ineffectiveness of his current negotiations with the Chinese. From the consulate the Japanese, who were quite likely army reservist ronin and seinendan, marched arrogantly up North Szechuan Road, fighting with Chinese youths and using their clubs to smash Chinese shop windows and batter streetcars and buses en route to the Japanese Marine Headquarters at Hengkou Park in the northern extension of the I.S. bordering Chapei. Along the busy thoroughfare they managed to scuffle with British and Indian police on the I.S. force, which prompted the mobilization of the entire I.S. police force to stand by for Sino-Japanese riots. Once they gained the attention of Marine Commandant Samejima, they threatened to petition the Japanese army to come to their aid if the navy refused to take the necessary action to defend them. >Escorted by marines back to the Japanese Club, the dissidents proceeded to regroup into yet another rally where they drafted demands for a January 23 ultimatum after which the ronin threatened to wreck the KMT headquarters, the Chinese city hall, the Minkuo newspaper office, and the I.S. municipal office. Reminiscent of the destruction meted out by militant Japanese civilians in Tsingtao just one week earlier over the Minkuo reference to the emperor, the dissidents also wanted the punishment of the British and Indian policemen who had just clubbed the Japanese protesters, plus indemnity! The rally raged on until an army colonel urged the agitators to go home and await instructions from Tokyo. Note 35. Army report to the General Staff, Jan. 22, 1932, JAA RI39 (F63545), 63581.

The Chinese counter demands paralleled those that Murai had made: (1) a Japanese apology, (2) punishment for the arsonist murderers, (3) payment for the damages and hospitalization, and (4) preventive measures against recurrences. >Murai admitted that Japanese had been involved but said that some Chinese workers fired earlier by Sanyu had also joined in the destructive binge as an act of revenge. He reminded the spokesman for Mayor Wu that a satisfactory Chinese response had yet to be received for the affront against the emperor in the Chinese Minkuo Jih-pao on January 9. Note 36. ""Chung-yang Jih-pao"", Jan. 22, 1932, 1.4. JA, Jan. 24, 1932, 1. His apology contrasted with that received a week before from the mayor of Tsingtao (after the Japanese ronin had burned out the local Minkuo building). The two sides at Shanghai were thus faced with an accretion of unresolved irritations that complicated a settlement. The Chinese felt peeved that the Japanese would consider how much indemnity to charge for the attack on the monks when the losses of life and property in Japanese Korea back in July had gone uncompensated -- the episode that had triggered the original anti-Japanese boycott. The Japanese seemed to the Chinese to be insensitive to the honor of others. On January 20, when the Chinese representative brought up the destruction of JRA demonstrators on North Szechuan Road en route to the naval headquarters, Murai countered with mention of the brutality of the police treatment there, which had resulted in two wounded Japanese. Note 37. ""Shih-chiu Lu- chun Kang-Jih Hsueh-chan-shih"" (The History of the Nineteenth Route Armys Bloody Battle of Resistance against Japan) (Shanghai: Shenchou Kuo-kuang-she, 1947), 2d ed., 62 (hereafter cited as Nineteenth RA Battle History), quotes Wus protest note, dated the twentieth. ""Kang Jih Chan-shih"" (History of the War of Resistance against Japan), ed. Chang Chi-yun (Taipei: National Defense Research Institute, 1966), 8. On the following day there were new signs that the two sides were beginning to stiffen in their obstinacy. The stage was now set for the escalation of provocations leading up to a conflagration designed to demonstrate mass anger on both sides. The natural anger of the Chinese people at yet another new gunboat invasion by yet another foreign power on the one hand and the staged religious persecutions on the other would create a firestorm in both the Japanese and Chinese press to kindle war fever in the people of both nations. But the unbalance in national scale was a Chinese illusion, since the industrial militarization of Japan had produced a war machine primed for conquest. That illusion was a perfect trap for the Chinese people and the government in Nanking to fall into."

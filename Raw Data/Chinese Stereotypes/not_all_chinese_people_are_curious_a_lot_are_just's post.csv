I was in Canada but I am Chinese ethnic and I have been here to help my family business. I often meet people telling me that Chinese are curious and yes, a large number are but,this is the only country where Ive experienced the following. . Grown men following me with cameras and suggesting sexual slurs (I have blonde dyed hair) . I was SA in Guangzhou by an older Cantonese guy (I couldnt understand much( who followed me down the river near the Canton Tower and not only touched my bum but proceeded to lick me. I reported it but nothing came of it. Women in particular stare at me aggressively when I explain I speak little Chinese . At the airport when I explain Im not a citizen or born here people (old) will loudly say Im a dirty foreigner and a disgrace (This is mostly around Suzhou where I am) . People have called me a sex worker because my husband is white but actually born in Hong Kong so he understands a lot (they assume Im a prostitute) . At the school I teach Ive had parents demand meetings and demand that I explain why I am Canadian (and the school says it is OK) . Ill never forget my Japanese friend visited and we went to XjAn and a young couple from Jiangxi called her a Japanese bitch and smiled towards me like Id agree. During COVID I was treated perfectly until people noticed I didnt have Chinese papers . I dislike the notion that Chinese are curious. A lot are but the fact is Ive faced so much hatred and sexual harassment here and I look as Chinese as you get. . "

Culturally and i have heard these complaints in China, Japan, and Korea the attitude is that if you are western regardless of ethnicity you are sexual promiscuous.  Plainly put: You sleep around and are an easy lay and are okay with pornography, explicit language and conversation. Where this stereotype comes from is bizarrely from some western women who do just that. This woman has to be an extreme but strangely from Asian men’s pov she is not an isolated incident. Also pornography is highly influential as western women with Asian men is highly popular and then if you are inexperienced sexually you will interpret this as factual and not fantasy. . . In regards to anti-xenophobia (anti foreign) and now just outright racist behavior this is directly from the ccp and their propaganda machine who have resurrected old school propaganda and are teaching children in school to say I hate foreign devils!

There are no foreigners allowed clubs (originally began as a response to Covid as the propaganda originally said it was the foreigners that created the coronavirus and gave it to China). In fact there are suggestions that the government for example hired “protesters” to shout the n word to a visiting black American basketball player. . . Hatred towards your Japanese friend is from the Sino-Japanese war and the war crimes atrocities that harmed civilians because the Japanese did not sign the Geneva conventions until 1944. So they just raped and murdered Nanjing massacre, kidnapped thousands of girls across Asia including Dutch nurses in Indonesia and sold tickets to their rape as ianfu or comfort women. Unfortunately to this day they do not teach war crimes to Japanese people in school which continue to fuel the anger in both China and Korea.

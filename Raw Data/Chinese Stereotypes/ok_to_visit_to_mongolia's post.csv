mongolia,SirHughMungo,t22ixmm1bf,t1l9ef5zx,t31djxczs,06/19/24 21:44,0,7,0,0,"""In most countries Ive been to, if you make sure youre polite and respectful, respect the local rules and traditions, and maybe make an effort to pick up some basic language skills, most people will treat you with the same respect and politeness. There will always be cunts, but thats unavoidable. Also a good rule of thumb: dont assume malice, when it can be explained by cultural differences. For example when I went to Kazakhstan, many Kazakhs, especially in more remote regions, will openly stare at you, and look you up and down from head to toe. My dumb ass thought the girls there where checking me out, but they literally do this to everyone, not just visitors. That being said Kazakhstan is very different to Mongolia, so maybe not the best example, but the point is, just be respectful, and dont make assumptions."""

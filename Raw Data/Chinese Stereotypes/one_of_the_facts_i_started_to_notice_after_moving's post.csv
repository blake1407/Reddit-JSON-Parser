Aged cheeses like parmigiana reggiano I personally like but I think the historical use was as ‘salt’ (natural msg), right? But most Chinese I notice find these ‘strong’ flavours a bit overpowering and controversial like ‘smelly tofu’ it’s an acquired taste that many will eat out of politeness but won’t crave like Italians might. So our concept of ‘quality’ can vary. I think generally Shanghai, Fujian, Canton, being coastal cities with lots of fishing and fresh produce have a ‘fresh is best’ preference. The only equivalent is a high price for dried deep sea fish, but being a poverty dish only in recent decades is it considered a nostalgic treasure. China also doesn’t have EU licenses or legal regulations for the branding of parmigiana reggiano, pecorino romano, etc which formed from Catholic monastic orders. Our monks were not capitalistic, and generally, our food is just food, and mostly ‘free market’. The market regulates itself as people naturally boycott fake products. Unlike the fake mortadella scandal before. . In fact, although we have similar delicacies  aged foods also have negative poverty connotation being subsistence survival foods in times of famine. Maybe like the ‘povera’ vs ‘fresca’ wings in Italy? But I guess it’s also dictated by climate and region. We eat what we have!. It’s interesting that you can open a jiaozi store. I think that’s great. But if I opened a ‘ravioli store’ in the West many Australian Italians and Italian Italians would surely be annoyed and resentful since ‘pasta’ is practically a pillar of Italian nationalism and tourism! Maybe having finding an Italian spouse is the key, haha!"""

We have the luck to have parmigiano reggiano cheese, and Im from Bologna where you can find high quality Mortadella ham.  Ravioli with Parmesan and Mortadella are made in Heaven.

It explodes on the first bite like a hot bon bon, and the ‘soup’ must be slurped slowly from the deep soup spoon. Plus, for those who have it with strong Chinese vinegar on the side its like having a splash of balsamic with each ravioli bite. Do any Italians do it like this?"""

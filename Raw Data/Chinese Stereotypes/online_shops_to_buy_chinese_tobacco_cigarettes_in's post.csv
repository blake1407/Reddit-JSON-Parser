I just wanted to ask, ""For Chinese people abroad, how do they typically buy Chinese-brand tobacco in America?""               . I remember there was a website I could use like 12 years ago to buy it, but I forget the name completely. If anyone has any sources or ideas, that would be great, as my company has recently taken on a Chinese client, and we would like to make a good first-impression with him.               . Thanks in advance!"

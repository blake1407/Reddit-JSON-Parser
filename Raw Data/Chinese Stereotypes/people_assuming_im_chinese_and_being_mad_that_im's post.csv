Don’t be assuming I’m Chinese and then getting mad when you find out that Im not!! I went to a hot pot restaurant and the woman behind the counter immediately spoke Chinese upon seeing my face. I politely chimed in while she was speaking to inform her that Im not Chinese (in English). She then got mad at me and waved her hand up and down while I was asking about seating. Wtf??? When I finished dining, I turned to her on my way to the door and she still had a frown on her face when seeing me. No “thank you,” no smile, no nothing. That’s what we called “mất dạy” in Vietnam (rude, ill-mannered). Never went back to that place of course. Another time, I went to a dim sum place and the woman said ""ni hao"" to me. I smiled and greeted her the same since it’s just a common Chinese phrase most people know. Then she spoke more Chinese and once again, I told her I didn’t understand. She also scrunched up her face at me. "

Even then, the rate at which immigrants have taken more than a thousand years to develop a single strain of mutation -- one that is no prevalent, nor dominant in genome duplication jackass. >In many cases, significant pesticide resistance has evolved in 5 to 50 generations in spite of great variation in the insect species, the insecticide, and the method of application. Theoretical population genetics helps us understand this apparent paradox. Many of the insecticide resistances result from single mutant genes. The resistance genes are often partially dominant, so the change in the frequency of the resistance gene is governed approximately by the equation. >.  in whichxa0pxa0andxa0qxa0are, respectively, the gene frequencies of the resistant and sensitive genes, initially (time 0) and at timexa0txa0generations after insecticide application, andxa0sxa0measures the degree to which resistant insects are favored over sensitive ones. Literally fucking states that out of the 5 RARE CASES OUT OF FUCKING 50 GENERATIONS, a tested sample to see if they were truly growing resistance to pesticides -- due to generations of farming -- has developed. Conclusion: FUCKING ZERO PERCENT AFTER 50 GENERATIONS (1,300 YEARS) have developed any form of pesticide resilience, and proven moot even after immigration/diaspora to different environments. Studies have also shown immigrants actually show lower genome mutations in rDNA due to a drastic change in ecosystems. Finally, your argument about you dont have the time is fucking stupid.

Chapter 5 bud:. >For example, because of the elaborate DNA-replication and DNA-repair mechanisms that enable DNA sequences to be inherited with extraordinary fidelity, only about one nucleotide pair in a thousand is randomly changed every 200,000 years. Even so, in a population of 10,000 individuals, every possible nucleotide substitution will have been “tried out” on about 50 occasions in the course of a million years—a short span of time in relation to the evolution of species. In case you dont want to do the math, dont worry: another source already did it for you as a third party cross-reference.

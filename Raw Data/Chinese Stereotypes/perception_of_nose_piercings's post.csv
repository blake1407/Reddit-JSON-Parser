Im moving to China for a semester in a couple of days, and a post asking about hair color got me thinking that maybe my face piercings might be viewed negatively in China. I have a small nose ring and a septum piercing - theyre simple silver hoops, nothing fancy or eye-catching. However, I now worry it might be too much there. I cant exactly take them out for half a year without the risk of the holes closing, and I dont much like wearing studs. Will this affect me negatively? Is there a stigma concerning piercings?. Id like to add I dont dress particularly alt, dont have tattoos and currently have my own natural hair color, so these factors wouldnt come into play. I just want to know more about the views of Chinese people on facial piercings. Thanks for any takes on this in advance xx"

I wore my nose ring to work everyday and had no problems, the only comments I ever really got where questions asking if it hurt to get and from people who thought it was cool. I brought a few spacers with me to wear for more formal business occasions, but I do that in my home country too. Also plenty of young people have tattoos and piercings it might not be nearly as many in some other places but you will definitely see other people with more body mods than you if you look hard enough!"""

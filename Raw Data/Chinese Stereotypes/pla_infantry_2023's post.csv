Ive seen that they are also significantly cheaper than all other options, you can use services like ParcelUp/Superbuy to help you purchase from TB. TB is Chinese so youd need a translator to look and search up in Mandarin. AliExpress Ive found, actually has some good options too, from accurate gear to some generic items with PLA camo slapped onto it such as backpacks and kneepads. Alibaba usually turned me away cause of how often Id see there needing to be a bulk order when Im looking for items for myself. RoyalTigerGear is also a real good place to buy accurate looking PLA gear from, expect prices to be high when factoring the item cost and shipping. eBay has some sellers with a majority of their stuff being PLA and there can be some sellers that may one-off list some unique things. . Reverse image searching on a search engine or within store sites is very helpful too. Ill try listing the essentials of the modern gear in XK (XingKong) camo as there is way too much. Selling things in PLA camo in China is usually not allowed so you usually may see helmets without covers or options for items that dont reveal camo. . Taobao:.  (sells a lot of PLA camo and related stuff).  (Ditto as above). .  (PLA NVG replica).  (Modern helmet goggles).  (High cut helmet).  (High cut helmet).  (Low cut helmet).  (PLA BDU patches)"""

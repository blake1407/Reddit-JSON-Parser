I want to start off by saying this is absolutely no disrespect to Minnie or G-IDLE. As a Thai person I admire Minnie so much for showcasing Thai culture and being an admirable role model for all young aspiring thai people around the world however something that really annoys me is the misconception of her being from Thai royalty or supposedly having royal blood. I recently became a neverland and one huge thing I see going around is that Minnie apparently is Thai royalty or has royal blood in her….which is completely a lie. Honestly this isn’t that deep however I really don’t like how rude some neverland can be when it comes to people educating them on this topic and becoming even overly defensive? Which I don’t understand because why does it matter wether she is royalty or not? Is this just some random flex the fandom wants to have over her? . From what I heard this rumor stemmed from her apparently having a relative that married into the Thai royal family? But saying she’s royalty by that logic is like saying Megan Markles cousins are now all of a sudden royalty because she married into the British royal family…. Like the British royal family, you’re NOT going to be having their family members be allowed to become big pop stars let alone be so involved in social media or industries in other countries…. Even if you’re not directly apart of the royal thai family and have royal blood then you would have  . the title Na Ayudha/Na Ayutthaya added to your surname to signify having descendants or relation to the royal bloodline, which as you know Minnie does not have. The biggest thing is, Minnie is a third generation Thai-Chinese. I’m not bringing this up to question Minnie’s Thai-ness as Thai-Chinese people are very integrated and assimilated into Thai society and many famous celebrities in Thailand are Thai-Chinese however Minnie’s direct family has probably only been in Thailand for maybe a few decades however the Thai royal family dates back to CENTURIES. If my grandparents moved to Great Britain from Thailand would there be a possibility that I’m somehow related to the British family?. I keep using references back to the British family because this lie is mostly spread from what I’ve seen through international/English speaking fans. I love Minnie however she is not Thai royalty in any way and even in Thai forums I have seen other Thai people wondering why this is such a huge misconception?. Outside of Minnie I have also seen this same white lie repackaged with other idols of Chinese and Japanese backgrounds…although I haven’t fully dived into it I’m just wondering why it’s such a huge coincidence that seemingly ALL of these random K-pop idols somehow have royal blood or are from a royal dynasty. . This isn’t that deep however something I’ve noticed is there are a lot of white lies spread around in the Kpop fandom that are treated like concrete facts…like that one famous quote from Namjoon that he HAS NEVER once said and till this day so many people still believe he’s said that. Another idol who I question is Yoongi from BTS. Same as neverlands, army’s claim that Yoongi has royal blood. Again this isn’t hate towards him however I have studied into some Korean culture and from what I’ve seen the only basis of him having royal blood is that his surname is Min and it’s not as common as other Korean surnames and there was once a Min clan/dynasty. By that logic almost 99% of the Kpop industry has royal blood as Kim/Lee/Park are all royal clans and dynasties themselves. I feel like army’s ran with this lie because his surname isn’t as common as the rest of the Korean idols however his surname isn’t SUPER RARE. I’ve met multiple Korean people with the last name Min and not just Korean but other Asians as well, sure it’s not super common but it’s not rare. However anyone can correct me if I’m wrong since I’m not a native Korean or know Korean culture 100% however as a native Thai I can say for 100% Minnie is not Thai royalty. Anyway that’s it :). Again no hate to Minnie or Yoongi! Just a correction for a misconception that I’ve seen a lot and maybe a conversation opener for why some Kpop fans randomly lie about stuff or spread misinformation (maybe every single Kpop fan are all secretly orbits?). EDIT: Ive seen some people say that this started off as a joke or people are just simply complimenting her. First off, Thai neverlands ourselves also call her thai princess and I have seen international fans do the same affectionately as well so Im not referring to those fans who are just complimenting her! (Ive seen people do the same for other female thai idols such as Lisa and Sorn) As I stated before I have met neverlands whove been rude about this topic,. straight up telling me a Thai person to educate myself or that I need to research and look it up myself. I actually decided to make this post right after some interactions beforehand. In my experience Ive met mostly neverlands who genuienly belive in this and get overly defensively rude about this on platforms like Tiktok and Instagram. If some peope are just joking thats fine and I have no problem with that but personally Ive seen a majority pass this around informatively like a fact. I also made this post for the neverlands who truly just believed this to be true. Other then some rude neverlands, Ive also met some other neverlands who just thought this was just some random fun true fact about Minnie. "

I don’t know/get why people can’t just like public figures or artist without trying to deify them. Though I also do think some people don’t remember how easy it is in many cases if you go far back enough to find some tie to nobility (and i agree with someone else in some cases people are confusing nobility with royalty) that means nothing especially today for many people bc a lot of people having a lot of kids or multiple marriages like some genealogist claiming Meghan markle has distant ancestry to King Edward III of 1327-1377 which means nothing today and i know I’ve seen similar claims for Kate Middleton even I’m confused which royal but similarly far off and even if true for either woman has nothing to do with the way any member of their living family or in living memory was raised or viewed or their own statuses before marriages to the actual British Royal family. Like hell while already nobility Diana Spencer is a direct descendent of another British dynasty then the current Windsor family, that didn’t make her royalty even if she became that with marriage to one prince and would have probably continued in some format at least informally even after divorce because of her being the mother of another prince and future king."""

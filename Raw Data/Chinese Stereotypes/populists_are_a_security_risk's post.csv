After the stabbing incident in Beijing, I posted a message to remind everyone not to argue or clash with Chinese people in public, especially white people, Japanese and Koreans, because some populists in China are extremely hostile to foreigners. . Some people said I was racist, which made me sad. I was clearly reminding people with good intentions. . A few days later, the Suzhou incident happened. What about the future? The government will definitely protect the safety of foreigners, but what about extreme populists? You still have to be careful. Rumor has it that the brave lady who fought the gangsters is dead."

People are more intolerant than ever.  Dont try to argue with anyone with this mindset as they are dangerous people."""

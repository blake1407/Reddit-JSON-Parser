A core claim made by Thomists is that 1) God is Pure Actuality and 2) God took very particular actions with a particular group of people, the ancient Isrealites. Both of these claims make sense on their own, but I dont see how they are consistent together. Part of being pure Actuality entails that there are no unactialized potentialities.  But the most straightforward way of understanding Gods Covenant with Israel is that he actualized a single potentiality while not actualizing others.  For example the potentiality of making a Covenant with the Chinese people. For contrast in a system like Plotinus NeoPlatonism, the One is beyond all Being  and is the Ground of all Being (he didnt conceive of the One as pure Actuality, but he did consider it the source of all things similar to how we conceive of God).  But for him any particular god is necessarily a set of actualized potentials in part because gods take particular actions and not others.  The gods exist at the level of Soul which is a different metaphysical level than the One. I heard a modern pagan make this argument, that Christians are engaging in a sort of double talk when they claim that God is both pure Actuality and that he was born to a specific woman at a specific town, etc. Ive been thinking about this for a while and dont know how to make sense of the Christian pov here."

From metaphysics to Providence, passing through Incarnation and history of salvation. But I will be quick:. Aquinas inherits Aristotles subdivision of potency: passive and active potency (check his Commentary on Metaphysics). Passive potency is being able to get actualized (the common use of the word potency). Active potency is being able to actualize other things. For example: a wall has passive potency to be painted. The paint has the active potency to paint that wall if so used (because it has that color in act). Now, only something in act can actualize a potency (aka ""you can only give what you got""). God has no passive potency because everything in Him is actualized to the last degree (aka Perfection). But as Actus Purus, He has active potency to actualize everything else (aka Omnipotence or Divine Power), because there is no perfection that He himself has not to the last degree. So, yes, He is actus purus and He ""actualized the covenant(s"") exercising His Divine Power (active potency). The part about neoplatonism, I will pass for now. I recently got banned in that sub after arguing that Plotinus ""pure potentiality"" is a contradiction in terms (I must add that perhaps I was a little bit sarcastic after a moderator asked the difference in significance between Jesus and a tree)."""

By definition, pure act, which has no potentialities whatsoever, is clearly not of this world, where every has potential/potency regarding some possible act/state of affairs. This is also the basis of the difference between time and eternity; God does everything all at once as one act, and we see that one act of God play out in time as multiple acts from our perspective. . God did not actual a certain potentiality without actualizing others from the eternity side of the equation; and this is clear in the covenants he makes with humankind prior to Abraham and Israel (which are nevertheless the basis for the Abrahamic, Mosaic, and Davidic covenants) and the covenant he makes with all humankind through Christ after (for which the Jewish covenants are also the basis). It is all one process of salvation history that extends to all, and the idea of non-Jewish holy people is not foreign to Scripture (Job is premised on that). And even in the Israelite-specific history, you find God having plenty of dealings with other peoples, and other peoples being brought to God (at least to some degree) through Israel (especially in Christ). . You misunderstand Neo-Platonism if you think that it is not ultimately more monotheistic than polytheistic in overall structure; it is simply not a strict monotheism (i.e. there is not only one God) but a loose monotheism (i.e. there is One God upon whom all other ""gods"" and spiritual beings absolutely depend for their being and divinity, and who ultimately rules over all things). It admits of lower deities/demons/""monads"" than the One, but the One is the source of their being and divinity by emanation/participation. The One seems to be the source of being/divinity for Nous and Soul (both upper and lower) as well, and is ""God"" in the truest sense, and is in many ways identifiable with ""pure act"". Ultimately in Neo-Platonism, these lower beings are gods in a lower and less true sense (and you can read that in the other Neo-Platonists like Iamblichus or Proclus), and such views are simply the philosophical way to allow for ancient Greco-Roman paganism to be reconciled with the system in a reasonable way. Indeed, Christianity effectively took that system and said ""actually, below God are the angels and demons, not gods in some lesser but still true sense"", and simply modified the system (see Dionysius the Areopagite, who is adapting and half-way plagiarizing Proclus). . What is particular to Christ is the mystery of his hypostatic union, but we may observe a few things. 1. The Sons divine nature is not changed by the Incarnation; it is the human nature that is; 2. We may attribute whatever change or actualization of potency as affecting the human nature and not the Divine Nature; 3. Again, on Gods side, these things are already actualized from all eternity, and merely playing out in history in a way we perceive as multiple. Eternity has priority and supremacy over time."""

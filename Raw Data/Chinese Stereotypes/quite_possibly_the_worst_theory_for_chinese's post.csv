ChineseLanguage,StanislawTolwinski,t2_9iextuje,t3_1dh48dv,,06/16/24 05:54,0,200,0.94,70,"""Quite possibly the worst theory for Chinese character etymology. To summarise, this man believes that the Chinese people migrated to the far east between 2300 and 2200 BC from Israel, bringing israelite folklore and the story of the old testament into ancient Chinese characters. However, instead of analysing ancient Chinese characters, he chooses to analyse modern ones.   . . This man repeatedly misinterprets characters for his own benefit, breaking down  into+ and doing similarly ignorant things, instead of going on Wiktionary and looking up an etymology arduously studied by scholars of Chinese. He also picks and chooses the meanings of components. The hubris to think that he knows Chinese characters better than scholars of Chinese as someone who couldnt write a single hanzi is astounding. "

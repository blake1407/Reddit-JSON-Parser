I really need some advice regarding a racism incident that happened at my workplace. Yesterday, I accidentally discovered that a colleague was mocking my cultural background, language, and nationality on our company’s Microsoft Teams during work hours. The conversation included remarks about how this “Chinese person” supposedly can’t listen or speak English well, along with mimicking Chinese people speaking English with a strong and funny accent. I feel incredibly frustrated, sad, and I couldn’t sleep last night. As the only Chinese person in this large company, I feel very isolated and helpless. I’ve reported the incident to my general manager, but he just said he would talk to HR and wait for the response from them. I have a feeling that this incident will just end with a simple apology like “Oh, I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to do that,” without any real consequences for those involved. I am deeply saddened by this situation and would appreciate any advice or support you can offer. Thank you!"

Tbh this is the real world, just imagine if you are in China and one of your colleague cannot even speak Chinese well, I cannot be sure that I won’t look down on him. So be good at English is a really vital thing in Australia.   However, you definitely need to teach your colleagues a lesson. Make fun of other people is nasty, they do this because inferiority was planted deep inside of them, they need to laugh at someone so that they feel they have power. Don’t feel bad about fighting back, maybe part of you agree with them (be good at English is important), but it’s definitely their fault to make fun of other people. You got every reason to fight back. .   I suggest if they talk shit behind you, you just go to them and express your feelings with simplest words like “Don’t say this, I feel bad”. It’s OK to look timid when you say this as long as it’s your real feeling. The important thing about this is let them realize you are also a human like them. Nobody will look down on you because you look timid, through this behavior they know you finally have the courage to face the fear and willing to do something about it. Most people won’t laugh at you after this, but some cuts may still do shit. If that’s the case, I recommend you make something like “final warning” to them, tell them you feel really bad about this and what you going to do if they continue. You can tell your boss, find legal support or even sue them. In Australia there are many thing you can do about this.

Update: It turns out that I AM a dummy and I AM the only American Dad fan who didn  know this. But don  worry, I won  bother posting in this sub anymore cuz jesus considering were on a sub for a friggin cartoon yall are some of the most humorless bullies Ive ever come across. Later world. Smell my ass!. (I hope Im not a dummy and like, the only American Dad fan in the world who didn  know this.). (Tldr at the end). In the episode, ""Weiner of Our Discontent,"" Roger puts himself in charge of what he calls ""death dogs"" (hot dogs with nitrite levels so high they could kill a man). Francine doesn  realize that they are poisonous, and takes them to Toshis house for a hot dog eating contest between him and Steve. Roger and Stan burst in during the contest and, fortunately, the poisoned hot dogs have not been distributed! And the following exchange occurs between Francine and Toshis mother:. Francine: Toshis mother insisted on using the hot dogs she bought. Apparently, the ones I brought weren  good enough. Toshis Mother: They weren . They would have killed our children. Francine: Im sorry dear, I don  understand what youre saying. To the group Does anyone speak sushi hostess?. Ok so did you guys know that Chinese people tend to be racist against Japanese people? Like, a lot. Like, 75% of Chinese people have something mean to say about the Japanese. Something like that. (You google it if you want specific details, I can  remember everything!). ANYWAY. Do you guys also remember that Francine was raised by Chinese parents and that Toshis family is Japanese?. So Francine pretended she couldn  understand Toshis mother because she was raised to be racist against the Japanese. . !!!!!!. Tldr; Francine was raised by Chinese parents and so was most likely raised to be racist against the Japanese, which might explain her dismissive attitude towards Toshis mother. Edit: I forgot the tldr "

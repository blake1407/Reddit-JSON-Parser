I know Ancestry kinda sucks at East Asian stuff and that Chinese people historically moved around less but wow . 100% Chinese is not exactly what I thought Id receive. Guess I now know for sure Im most definitely a Chinese person.  "

I’m African American & been in Ancestry since ‘11. The sheer advancements are astounding. I have VA & its surrounding areas as ground zero. But after the latest update I’m seeing African American subgroups in Missouri, Arkansas & even Texas. Wonder what the overall percentage of Ancestry’s user and/or DNA database is rooted in predominantly Asian origins? As that population grows Id anticipate some visible deviation."""

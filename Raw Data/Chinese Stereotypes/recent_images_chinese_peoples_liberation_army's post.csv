WarshipPorn,spectre,t242brwy8a,t1l93722m,t1l92sho1,,0,-7,0,0,"""This sub needs to get consistent with their views. If the J-20s stealth works (as people purport), why not use that for the J-35? And if the J-35s stealth is the only stealth that works, why not use it on the J-20?"""
WarshipPorn,raidriar889,t2bh8t3,t1l92t0p7,t1l92sho1,06/17/24 21:10,5,-9,0,0,"""Chinese hackers stole more than just what you can tell by looking at them."""
WarshipPorn,yippee-kay-yay,t2mh92d,t1l92sho1,t1l91aak0,06/17/24 19:36,5,8,0,2,"""And?. Have You Taken a look at every other 5th gen fighter out there outside of the J-20 and Su-57?. . They all look like F-35/F-22s bastards because, as it turns out, radar waves are same in Nevada, Seoul or Beijing and similar requirements will breed similar designs"""
WarshipPorn,raidriar889,t2bh8t3,t1l93bivn,t1l92knxf,06/17/24 21:40,4,-2,0,0,"""You clearly didn’t even look at the source before dismissing it out of hand, because the information came from the documents Edward Snowden leaked to the German press, and the article was written by a guy named Franz-Stefan who lives and works in London. But clearly it’s just a US source lying about China."""
WarshipPorn,thinkman77,t2rzyw2,t1l92knxf,t1l92ewxk,,7,4,0,1,"""Mate It seems like you are from the US. I have good American friends but even they realize US sources cant be trusted. Calling someone an idiot for pointing out the obvious bias seems unhelpful. If tomorrow Chinese TV agency says Xi Jinping is the best im gonna put questions on that too."""
WarshipPorn,raidriar889,t2bh8t3,t1l92ewxk,t1l928nn0,06/17/24 18:41,6,-9,0,1,"""Good for you, you don’t have to trust US sources because the documents were published by a German source. And if don’t think China’s stealth fighters have benefitted from information “gained” from the US , even if they aren’t just reverse engineered copies, you’re a fucking idiot."""
WarshipPorn,thinkman77,t2rzyw2,t1l928nn0,t1l91aak0,06/17/24 18:05,5,6,0,1,"""I probably wouldnt trust any US sources on china. US media outlets have a tendency of badmouthing India, China, South Africa. With the whole philippine fiasco being an example."""

WarshipPorn,RamTank,t2gg2tw,t1l90493i,t1l9030r9,06/17/24 10:13,2,3,0,0,"""I think some of the confusion might be because of what the ""J-20A"" is. Traditionally it referred to the WS-10 planes, but I think now those are just J-20s and the future WS-15 planes are J-20As."""
WarshipPorn,beachedwhale1945,t2lxy8t,t1l9030r9,t1l901fs0,06/17/24 10:05,9,3,0,1,"""I’ll try and correct the article tonight, if I remember."""

WarshipPorn,RamTank,t2gg2tw,t1l8zzhvy,t1l8zulrh,06/17/24 09:46,6,3,0,1,"""Production J-20s are WS-10s, pre-production (and I think early runs? I might be wrong on that) were AL-31s. WS-15s arent in service quite yet."""
WarshipPorn,EasternRooster471,t2kzsfd1zq8,t1l8zuw5s,t1l8zulrh,06/17/24 09:42,5,4,0,0,"""They probably have their own reasons for doing so. Just like how the USN wanted the F-18 with 2 engines rather than the F-16. My guess is either redundancy or ease of production though"""
WarshipPorn,beachedwhale1945,t2lxy8t,t1l8zulrh,t1l8zhagg,06/17/24 09:10,5,6,0,2,"""And to be clear the WS-10 used on the J-10 and WS-15 used on production J-20s is more powerful than the WS-13 used on the FC-31/“J-35”. Shenyang chose to give their prototype two engines with reduced power rather than a single more power engine, long before it was clear this would operate aboard carriers."""
WarshipPorn,One-Internal4240,t2alhgmitc,t1l8zv472,t1l8zhagg,06/17/24 09:08,4,6,0,0,"""Or they wanted to have an engine thats not running hot enough to burn out its own asshole. The 135 is - lets not mince words here - an incredible engine, and the Shenyang would blood sacrifice their firstborn to get their hands on one (or the tooling for one). But lets also be evenhanded: she runs very, very, very warm, to such an extent that its causing problems. But like everything else, its all driven from design, and they needed such extremes to support all the other scifi requirements."""
WarshipPorn,EasternRooster471,t2kzsfd1zq8,t1l8zhagg,t1l8zf7nx,06/17/24 09:12,4,14,0,2,"""Or they want 2 engines for carrier ops. . Its not like the PLAAF havent produced 1 engined fighters before. They made the J-10, its not like they cant make one."""
WarshipPorn,Inside-Line,t211gvob,t1l8zf7nx,t1l8z6xxc,06/17/24 07:17,3,-14,0,1,"""I think its like as close a copy to the f35 they could get but without a good enough engine, so they had to squeeze two into the same airframe."""

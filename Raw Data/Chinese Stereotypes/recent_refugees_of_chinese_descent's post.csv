I’m looking for thoughts on immigration, and I’m Chinese, so particularly thoughts on recent Chinese arrivals. I generally believe our country needs immigration and needs to fulfill our global duty to take in refugees. In the last 3 years, I have learned of multiple stories of recent refugees here in Canada of Han Chinese descent coming from mainland China and Hong Kong.  I know those coming from the Balkans and/or Europe through flights into the Balkans, and those coming from Mexico also exist — unlikely from Hong Kong and more likely from Mainland China. What kind of policy would be the most reasonable, that can bring the most people together?. Background: Thinking through settler colonialisms in this country and in China from my own position of privilege, I do some level of being an ordinary helpful person to the one Chinese person who is in the process of getting PR from getting to remain in Canada through the humanitarian route of seeking asylum (overstaying visitors visa, had partner who initiated a spousal sponsorship and who then abandoned) while trying to more support Indigenous mutual aid efforts and lgbtq refugees from countries with lower GDP, HDI and (arguably) lower democracy index. MENA region specifically. In all of this, I learned through the grapevine that one Chinese person already in Canada who stood a good chance at securing refugee status due to political persecution decided to get to the embassy of their emigration/origin country to turn themselves in. I also learned that half the Chinese people who don’t speak English & came as recent refugees I am in contact with stuck with English-learning, one person got into government-subsidized housing in a very competitive city, and no one has stable employment and no one had gone on a consistent trip to the Gov work agency in their area.  I had sponsored a lgbtq refugee from the MENA region before via Group of Five. My initial thought is that canadian immigration + economic policy is not working well in that this country is recently reporting a weakened economy with job losses, rate cut with likely an aim of 3% inflation goal (so realistically, BoC good with a ~4.5% real inflation), government spending is quite high, certain provincial governments considered ‘left of centre’ putting out rental subsidy policies that benefit low-to-middle income earners ($100k annual income for doula income families) while trying not to hike total government spending as a response to the rising popularity of more fiscally conservative parties, and, all the homeless shelters in our urban centres are overcapacity with primarily both urban Indigenous folks and refugees in them and awaiting for entry.  And the polls are reading that conservative parties are polling similarly to ruling centrist parties, showing major momentum.  Immigration policy especially refugee+settlement policy is top of mind. Again, what kind of policy would be the most reasonable, that can bring the most people together? What is the conversation like amongst your refugee-sponsoring and supportive friends? And for yourself, especially if you’re from an immigrant and refugee background in East Asia and you have your pulse on the ground on East Asian recent refugees?"

Ive recently come to consider the federal government to have put the country into a hoarding crisis. This with respect to hoarding as being unable to medically and financially provide care for the lives taken on. With animals its a crime, but with the nation, its progressive?. I am not against immigration, I think its the crux of a growing nation. However, the infrastructure needs to be supplied to manage it. People are being brought to this country en-mass without ensuring to meet adequate demands of shelter, employment, and medical needs. Just like a minimum wage worker who has 5 dogs 10 cats and 2 rodents, were all going to end up matted with parasites and malnourished should this continue."""

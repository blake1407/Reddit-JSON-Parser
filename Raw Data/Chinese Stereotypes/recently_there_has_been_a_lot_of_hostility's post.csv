I truly detest their government and the atrocities done in our homeland and to our people. . However, I dont believe we should blindly hate ALL of the Chinese people for a lot of them probably dont even want to support their government, but because of the draconian laws and punishments in their country, they are pressured to stay silent. . The reason for this post is because recently Ive seen a lot of discrimination, racist remarks, and straight up hatespeech against ordinary Chinese and even Half Pinoy/Half Chinese people, both on  and off Reddit. . This pains me to see because I do have Chinese and half chinese friends and for them to be labeled as spies or called the most deragory terms because of the ongoing issues between China and PH, its unfair to them. . IMO"

I dont think you knew that, but I just wanted to inform you cause I am sure you dont want to offend anyone. Be safe bro."

Obviously not every person who uses a slur will not be saying it with a malicious intent, and that is an important distinction. But no matter what slur it is it holds weight, leading me to again side towards caution."""
jasontheweenie,Thin-Sweet-7934,t212340fjgap,t1lbupjcl,t1lbuom4v,07/06/24 01:21,5,1,0,1,"""actually thats a fair point abt being cautious. it jus that most of the time when ppl (or ig jason in this case) use chink, its meant to be more comedic than actually diss. obv it could def be taken as offensive. but then again, the majority will understand it aint deep. anything you do or say can be taken as offensive too."""
jasontheweenie,Material-Hearing1509,t213yan0n4u8,t1lbuom4v,t1lbumr2p,07/06/24 00:57,4,-7,0,1,"""I get what youre saying, but I think its important to remember that no matter who is it used on doesnt change the fact that the word was meant to be used against Chinese people, and is in reference to Chinese people. No Matter who it is used on its meaning will always be in reference to Chinese people. I think there are multiple angles you can look at the topic, but I dont think any opinions on the topic should be diminished. You may feel like it doesnt matter as long as theyre Asian, but there are some people who believe it does. Theyre both just different opinions, ultimately I think its best to side with caution."""

jasontheweenie,Material-Hearing1509,t213yan0n4u8,t1lbuli42,t1lbukbfx,07/06/24 00:21,2,-14,0,1,"""Thats a fair point, but I know a lot of Chinese people believe that the c-slur can only be reclaimed by other Chinese people. Even if it used to attack all asians, it was something made in regard to chinese people, and no matter who it is used on it will be a slur about chinese people purely because of why it was made. You have a point, but I think the use of the C-slur by non-chinese people is still questionable."""

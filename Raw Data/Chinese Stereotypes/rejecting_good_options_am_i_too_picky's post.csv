I was born and raised in Southeast Asia, though I am also Canadian and have a house and relatives there I visit regularly. In our society, Chinese girls are always pressured into trying to find decent Chinese boyfriends to marry etc. The reason for this is the Chinese population where I live isn’t very big. Going on set-ups organized by friends or parents is the norm here coz there really aren’t many Chinese people. Most girls succeed at this by the time they are in their thirties. Although I’m only 24, my parents are worried about me finding a significant other and their friends set me up (again, it’s the norm here). I’ve been lucky enough that when I have been set up on dates with guys I really dislike, they always turn out to have red flags so I have an excuse to be turned down. I’ve also been asked out by a couple of guys, of course. But one of them turned out to be a serial playboy. Another guy I dated and who everyone in my family and friend groups liked turned out to have a secret girlfriend. . I’m lucky enough my family is wealthy so I don’t have to rush or settle as much as others. . HOWEVER, now I have a problem. My parents have friends who keep dropping hints on me dating their son. My parents have artfully skirted around the issue. I have met these two guys before and I really don’t like them. They’re not bad, but they’re not my type and we don’t vibe well. One is very religious and one is a bit slow. The problem now is the parents of the slow one keep trying to drop hints that I should try dating her son. For context, the son is not autistic per se in the sense that he was able to go to a regular school. However, all his younger siblings are autistic and had to go to a special school. I’ve had classes with him before though, and while he hasn’t been diagnosed as autistic, he acts very slow and most people assume he is on the spectrum due to his intelligence level. His parents also keep insisting that he isn’t autistic but he acts very annoying and slow with me and my friends. He can’t follow simple instructions and doesn’t know how to socialize, and he has no friends. I’ve explained to my parents that I cannot date someone who really doesn’t vibe with me at all. They agreed with me but my mom warned me that I shouldn’t be picky or else I’ll end up alone. She said I may feel confident now because I’m pretty and from a wealthy family, but I might regret rejecting dating these guys who are arguably nice after I reach a certain age.   . TLDR; rejected some nice guys coz they weren’t my type and could not vibe with their personalities at all (one is too religious, other one is very slow in terms of intelligence) — is this okay? I really would rather wait for the right person than settle for someone who really irks me. "

Advice is to be more active.xa0 Put yourself out there socially and use the apps.xa0 As you age it will be more difficult to find good guys.xa0"""

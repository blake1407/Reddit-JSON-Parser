So I have an uncle (married to my aunt) who is of a different ethnicity (Japanese-American) and he’s very open about his political views. My family is Chinese-American and we always hear him making jabs about China (the typical things like gutter oil, surveillance, how Chinese people in China are brainwashed, uneducated, rude, etc.), and it just feels unimaginably rude for HIM to say all this in front of us. . He doesn’t say anything to us or about us specifically, but we can’t help feel a little uncomfortable. He can’t actually expect us to join in and feel like it’s just playful banter. Anything we want to say, we just keep it to ourselves and we tend to just give a light nod without responding to anything. Every single time he opens his mouth, I get pissed off all over again. I have an urge to take a jab towards him and saying stuff about Japan during WWII, but I refuse to stoop to his level and feel like it’d be uncalled for towards the Japanese people. But I’m seriously so pissed off and annoyed!! It also feels as if he’s trying to make us feel ashamed to be from China, but we’ve always treated him with courtesy and refuse to not feel proud of our own culture and heritage. . Like seriously, I don’t think I’ve seen him not talk about it at least ONCE when we meet up for dinner. Honestly, his feelings are his own and I don’t care what he thinks but at least have some tact to NOT be an asshole and talk about it in front of your wife’s entire family. He seriously brings down the entire mood, and everyone has to try moving on to talk about other things. "

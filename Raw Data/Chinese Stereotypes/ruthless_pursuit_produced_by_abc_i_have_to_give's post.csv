While surfing online recently, I watched a film named “Ruthless Pursuit”xa0and did some further reading about Chinese “private police”xa0from the ABCxa0unintentionally. Firstly, I have to admit that the video is very ABC! It’s like watching a case-by-case story performed by a group of extras, and it seems to be a low-budget film made and spliced together with AI (After all, I’ve often seen films about China from Cannes that are much more interesting than this). I think the ABCxa0could have invested a little more in getting at least a few English-speaking Chinesexa0to act in thisxa0“film”.xa0. By the way, I have to roast about the poor English of these Chinese people, which makes audiencesxa0feel uncomfortable (although the female journalist with an oriental face looks beautifulxa0enough), not to mention that there is axa0leading actor with strong Chinese accent. The poor Englishxa0of the actorsxa0drives me to give the film a low score.xa0However, their acting skills are still worth appreciating. I even think that one of thexa0Chinese men with a unique appearance has much better acting skills than Jimmy Buffettxa0(music artist, actor and producer)!xa0Some of the “actors”xa0don’t even speak English at all. They speak their native language, i.e. Chinese the whole time. There are also some people (people who are called bosses by the so-called “private police”) who say strange Chinese dialects, which makes me completely at a loss. Isn’t it true that they are all international spies from China? Is this the English proficiency of Chinese international spies?. In addition, the person named Eric, who was reported to be a 22-year-old college student obsessed with western democracy, said he joined the Chinese Social Democratic Party established in the United States in 2007.xa0I can’t see the slightest hint of Western obsession from him. Then I want to watch his so-called “V Bridge”xa0exciting videos on YouTube (After all, I have never seen terrorist organizations from China before). Unfortunately, I couldn’t find even one video I expected, so I have to give this film a relatively low score. I almost burst out laughing when he said, “American officials have taken me seriously”. Americans even ignored Guo Wengui and confiscated $1.4 billion from him. I don’t think this Eric will make that much money in Australia, and he looks really poor in the film! The film also mentioned the cooperation between the Chinese and Australian police. “Taking people away from Australia forcibly”? I think it’s complete nonsense. As far as I know, the Labour Party has been restricting immigration from China (but Chinese people seem to be very enthusiastic about immigrating to Australia). Moreover, we know that the support rate of the Labour Party is steadily declining. I have reason to suspect that the opposition party is using these Chinese actors to strike against the Labour Party. At this point, I cant’t help but raise the question again, why did this low scoring film about China make it to ABC?"

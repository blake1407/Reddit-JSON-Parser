SS: An informative BBC article about an elaborate  scam in which criminals pretend to be Chinese police. . Article:.  Scammed by the fake Chinese police - BBC News. Chinese people around the world are being targeted by an elaborate scam in which criminals pretend to be Chinese police. A British-Chinese woman has told the BBC that she handed over her life savings to con men who wore uniforms in video calls and gave her a virtual tour of what appeared to be a police station. >Helen Young still has nightmares about the fortnight that she was made to believe she was on China’s most wanted list. >Scammers posing as Chinese police manipulated the London-based accountant into believing she was under investigation for a massive fraud back in her homeland. >Helen was presented with a mountain of fabricated evidence which appeared to implicate her in a crime she knew nothing about. When the fake police then threatened her with extradition to a jail cell in China, Helen sent them her £29,000 life savings as “bail money”, in a desperate attempt to stay in Britain. >“I feel a bit stupid right now,” she says. “But theres no chance I can know thats not real. Its so convincing”. Helen’s story may sound extraordinary but there have been numerous similar cases in the Chinese diaspora. Cont. . . . . Video:.

I first heard of this scam about seven years ago in a couple of brief articles that mentioned  Chinese people in Australia were being  targeted. It was good therefore to read the BBC article, which goes into greater depth."""

Add to it the large number of potential victims around the world, and its really not that surprising."""
Scams,wanderingmemory,t2142f7n8,t1lc1emev,t31dxgjia,07/07/24 09:43,1,5,0,2,""">So why are Chinese people seemingly so vulnerable to this type of crime. A few possibilities.  Just like people of any ethnicity and nationality, there are some small percentage of suckers.   They have done something shady in the past, even if its not exactly what they are accused of now. This may not be saying they are a horrible violent criminal, they may just have done some under the table things that are necessary to work.   They really have not done anything, but they think they may be targeted for other, perhaps political, reasons. The fact that the Chinese police almost certainly do act extrajudicially and try to influence Party members overseas doesnt do anything to help. Disclaimer, I am Chinese. Its a really well known scam. I think some Chinese police department even said, If you have committed a crime, we will not give you a warning by calling you, we will just arrest you."""

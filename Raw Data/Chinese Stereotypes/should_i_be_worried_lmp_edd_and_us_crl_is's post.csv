pregnant,Dazzling_Broccoli_37,t2_xtipcfk9c,t3_1dpc3hb,,06/26/24 18:55,0,1,1.0,4,"""Should I be worried? LMP EDD and US CRL is different. So my last menses date is 4/5. I even have my conception date of 15/5. Based on LMP, it is EDD 5 February. However Ytd at my scan, baby is CRL 15.7mm, short of 3mm to make it to 8 weeks. My EDD has been adjusted to 8 Feb. Should I be worried? Gynae says baby is growing well and has strong heartbeat. . Truth be told Iâ€™m sorely disappointed as I wanted to hit 8W ASAP as miscarriage rates fall and I wanted an earlier EDD (Chinese people will understand). "

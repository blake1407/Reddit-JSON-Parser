Ive been travelling solo through China for a couple of weeks now (Beijing, Shanghai, Haungshan), and going to Guilin next (yeah Ill have to put up with the rain, had planned it already). I was hoping to end the trip with some time in Hainan and then fly out of Hong Kong. . Ive heard mixed reviews about Hainan but its an easy flight from Guilin and into HK. Ill probably like it, but Im also hoping to meet some new people because Im traveling  alone. Chinese people have been very helpful and nice, but of course English is limited around here. . Any suggestions on places to meet new people (fellow travellers or otherwise) in Hainan? . (Side note, if you know if any latino events or clubs/bars that play latino music in Hainan, thats always helpful because Im Colombian). Thanks!!! Very happy with the China experience so far (minus the mobile apps)"
chinalife,andresmullen,t26h0cifim,t1l8zkze8,t1l8zj7fn,06/17/24 07:51,9,1,0,0,"""Yeah Im hoping to find a place to stay that can help out with the vehicle/motorbike. Ive already been in china for a while though, so Im finally in most of the mobile apps that I need to hail a cab, buy things, chat, order a coffee etc  . The heat might be tough but, as long as it isnt raining I can probably get along with it. I know SE Asia and Chinese heat is on another level, but im no stranger to Caribbean heat. My main thing is just hopefully getting some socializing in, Im going to Chengdu for a few days so hopefully that can make up for some of that though as well. Thanks"""
chinalife,gzmonkey,t2rofki,t1l8zj7fn,t1l8yukl5,06/17/24 07:35,8,1,0,1,"""May (after the holiday) to July is always the lowest of the low season. Sanya has really just one high season from September to April and the rest of the year most Chinese find Sanya unlivable because of the heat. September to January is good for surfing and sports, but it rains a ton, and often typhoons rolling through the region. Probably the biggest hurdle for most foreigners coming is dealing with the language barrier and how inclusive most systems are in China. Anything from hailing a taxi to just going to a normal restaurant and not seeing anything but chinese text is a huge barrier that you dont deal with in Thailand or Indonesia as many of the locals can speak some English. Also not being able to rent a vehicle or motorbike is probably a deal breaker for a lot, and you really need it in Sanya. Things are quite spread out unfortunately."""
chinalife,andresmullen,t26h0cifim,t1l8yukl5,t1l8vmrhw,,7,1,0,1,"""Thanks for all the information. I was actually about to ask what the reason was that people even go to sanya since on reddit everyone seems to trash talk it and say that Thailand is better lol. But the hotel/resort prices for sanya right now seem really good. Combine that with easy and relatively cheap airplane tickets, seems OK although maybe missing some of the diversity of tourist crowd. Anyways I heard that june may actually be lower season in sanya, so maybe that will help cleanse the beaches and such a bit."""
chinalife,gzmonkey,t2rofki,t1l8vmrhw,t1l8vkwgm,06/17/24 02:46,6,3,0,1,"""Who is going to go to Hainan if you can go to Thailand. I dunno, I definitely feel Sanya has leveled up a bit while places like Phuket and Bali have been overrun over the past few years-- all pre-covid. I own a home in Phuket, so have lots of data points on that one. Bali less so, but I spent a month there last year and felt like many of the Beaches have really gone downhill, and the influx of nomads have definitely caused prices to rise. Having some proper resorts in Sanya now which come in as better quality (at least in my opinion) and lower price definitely have made me feel like Sanya could compete, but China gets such a bad reputation that I doubt it could any time soon. Im sure theres still plenty of better places in SEA depending on what you are after but on the high end side, maybe not too many places. Not pro-china or hainan or anything, but where I would have overlooked Hainan previously, I will definitely consider much higher now. I definitely dont go for areas like Dadonghai. I also drive in China which makes my experience probably a lot different than most."""
chinalife,aDarkDarkNight,t2uquwz7zv,t1l8vkwgm,t1l8vk3i1,06/16/24 12:30,5,2,0,1,"""Yeah, covid Hainan and todays Hainan are quite different in terms of the numbers of foreigners and where they came from. All those foreigners you saw during covid were us ex-pats that couldnt get out of the country, so we went to Hainan. And conversely the Russians you didnt see is because they are tourists so couldnt get in. Now its the reverse. I dont know if its as many as pre covid as I had only been then once or twice, but definitely they outnumber the English speaking tourists by a wide margin. Makes sense. Who is going to go to Hainan if you can go to Thailand, Vietnam etc? Not many westerners, thats for sure."""
chinalife,gzmonkey,t2rofki,t1l8vk3i1,t1l8vcyzd,06/16/24 12:18,4,2,0,1,"""I spent 6 months driving around Hainan during Covid split between 2021 and 2022. I havent been back since the end of the covid restrictions lifted, but Ive been there on and off before Covid happened, and there was already major drop off in Russians from what I recall back in the last 2000s when the Thailand situation changed. They are still there, but not nearly as many anymore at least right prior to Covid. It was quite different mid-2000s, all of Sanya was little Russia. . What about Houhai? Did you make it there? Reyue is a bit more hit and miss, before it was mostly just people camping, but recent years saw the development of shore restaurants and a few shitty hotels, but the typhoon in 2022 destroyed a shit ton of it, not sure whats happened since. Remember surfing out in the Typhoon waters and waking up the next day after the typhoon passed and seeing the devastation on all of Wanning."""
chinalife,aDarkDarkNight,t2uquwz7zv,t1l8vcyzd,t1l8v26qg,06/16/24 12:13,3,1,0,1,"""Not sure when you were last there, but I have been three to four times a year since covid, including last Christmas and about 6 weeks ago and Dadonghai was over 90% Russian. Heard one other foreigner speaking English. Last 3 times at Reyue didnt see a single foreigner. If you were mainly there during covid then that time was an absolute anomaly in terms of foreigners."""
chinalife,gzmonkey,t2rofki,t1l8v26qg,t1l8tt63t,06/16/24 10:15,2,1,0,1,"""Theres definitely a few more options than Dadonghai, which hasnt really been a Russian spot since Thailand opened up visa-free arrangements to Russians. AFAIK, theres only 2 or 3 three direct flights a week to Sanya from anywhere in Russia anymore where there had been like 4-5 a day at one point but if you look at Phuket or Bangkok, there are a fuck ton to so many little shit holes in Russia that most people will have never heard of. I have a few Russian friends who confirmed that as soon as Thailand opened up to them, no one wanted to go to China anymore as Thailand was cheaper and overall better experience. . In terms of like minded English speaking (including Chinese) people though, Houhai (which has gone very commercial in recent years) and Wanning (Half Moon Bay) still turn up a bit of a surfers vibe with a bunch of beach bars and clubs at each, but year by year, each location turns it into a bunch of typical Chinese tourist area. But I would try both, Houhai being quite a bit bigger and closer to some foreign branded/foreign owned (in a few cases) hotels being located within Haitang Bay. Haitang Bay you get a bunch of really nice top tier resorts even compared to SEA, which do have foreigners working in them, so theres definitely some options around, just dont expect anything like SEA. Sofitel is probably in my opinion the best property and very underrated on that strip. You might have some luck with Haikou as well, but its not really a traveller spot. You can skip pretty much everywhere else, but if you like rockets, the Hilton Wenchang (which is a dump in my opinion) faces the rocket launch pad which is about two kilometers away. Ive seen two launches from there a few years ago. /u/andresmullen"""

chinalife,aDarkDarkNight,t2uquwz7zv,t1l8tt63t,t31dgv09c,06/16/24 02:31,1,4,0,2,"""Only place with any chance is Sanya, specifically Dadonghai. But 90% of them are Russians. You can try Dolphin Bar on the main street through Dadonghai to meet some other foreigners."""

When Trump  comes to power, he better blood bath the Chinese in America, confiscate their property and turn them into slaves. This will make them realize what happens when they betray their motherland."". Most Chinese never go abroad and whether foreigners hate Chinese people has no effect on them. And some consider Chinese who have emigrated to be traitors and want these countries to turn against China, thus penalizing these immigrants. "

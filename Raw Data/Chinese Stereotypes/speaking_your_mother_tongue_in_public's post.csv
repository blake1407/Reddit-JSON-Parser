How comfortable do you feel when speaking your Asian language in public when youre in a western country?  . So Im actually British Chinese, and grew up only being allowed to speak Cantonese ""at home"" to my family, this extends to public places.  I also grew up with Canto-speakers as some of my closest friends.  This means that speaking Canto while out and about is essentially second nature to me, and these days, I don  think the people around me particularly care. Long story short, most British Chinese people I know will happily speak Chinese in public. Now the reason for my post, I got to know an American Chinese woman a few years ago, she married a British Chinese guy in the UK.  What intrigued me was that although her Canto is perfectly competent, she was very reluctant to speak it in public.  Its been a long time, so from what I recall, the reason was that in the States the general public would react very negatively, sometimes aggressively towards people who are not speaking English.  And to some extent, she feels like its rude not to speak English when youre in public so overall, she doesn  feel comfortable doing so. I realise that this is a sample of one, so I was wondering if that tracks with other Asian American peoples experiences?  How about Asians living in other countries?. For what it worth, I know a few Dutch Chinese people and they also seem pretty happy speaking Chinese in public."

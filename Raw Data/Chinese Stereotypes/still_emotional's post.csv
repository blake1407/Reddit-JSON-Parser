I get  very hot and tight in the throat. with tears filling my eyes, snot - just pouring down. here goes. take this to heart. everyone. we may be divided like never before as a nation. but i ask you to picture this. Its the 3rd of July. hot. neighborhood in anywhere DSM.  (lower beaver) right by where all the people from everywhere else in the world lives. they got africans mexicans and chinese people all up in them apartments. well - I cruise up and watch and observe an illegal firework presenation .  against the law. but fuck it. freedom. right?. and its all people from everywhere else. lots of accents and smells of food (i think) and yes, drinking of adult liqour. They did have red dew and some orange pop too. kids all happy. and then it happened. somewheres close had theyre closer.  big bangs. lots of fire power. made me think of my cousin who told me about the Grenada invasion.  So there we all are gathered in patriotic wonder. lots of OOHS and AAHHH.  then I heard it.   . Or him I should say.   . Little voice. Lone sparkler in his hand. crocs, cut offs and a muscle T that had a flying eagle and USA is No. 1 across it.   . ""I PROUD TO BE MERICAN -WE LEST WE KNOW WE FREE -WE PROUD TO BE MERICAN-"". . Little guy didn  know the words. But goddammit he tried. and I knew it was Lee Greenwood. Shit, you reading this knew too. Little fucker got me all choked up just thinking bout his little voice. His little sparkler. .   . I felt bad telling officer Juarez at QT about their illegal fire works but I don  think he was going to be writting any tickets that night. Because goddammit. Freedom.   . Then Saturday Happens. .   . Rule of 3 hits. Bev 9er gal, Richie Simmons and Dr. Ruth. -- Lifes precious everybody. Love on each other today. Love on a stranger.   .

These are typically selling for $64.99 new and appear to be a cross between the $100 Bushnell Legacy WP and $150 Nikon Action Extreme EX. Image quality is very good and these are rather large and heavy  Binoculars estimated at around two pounds. . Close focus is literally non-existent with probably around 20 feet minimum focus. FOV doesnt seem to be as wide as their advertised 342 FT due to some apparent tunnelling. . I personally do not recommend buying anything from SVBONY in China because they screwed me and a friend over twice regarding shipping wrong items and charging higher price than advertised and never making it right after they already got paid twice. My friend ordered a cheaper Binoculars and received one of the eyepieces totally disassembled completely off of the main housing so much for the nitrogen inside. They wouldnt send a prepaid return shipping label and the eyepiece did not unscrew itself during shipping. It had appeared to be thrown in with the Binoculars before they were shipped. This company is absolutely dishonest and greedy money hungry Chinese people straight from China. They absolutely would not make it right and are in fact theyre banking on their customers not wanting to pay $100.00 out of pocket to send them back to China. This is what I call a very dishonest company with absolutely no morals to avoid. . Reason I bought these SA204s is was a package deal with the Meopta B1.1. Otherwise FUCK SVBONY. "

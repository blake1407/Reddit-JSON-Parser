taiwan,Gold_Umpire_6871,t2_woh3sgfts,t3_1drjvqb,,06/29/24 16:11,0,0,0.21,20,"""Taiwanese Citizenship by Ethnicity. So, I am in a complicated situation right now. Because I am a flaming homosexual from a Muslim country, I need Taiwanese citizenship. I am immigrating from my country of origin to the United States of America, so for now I am in the TECO Boston jurisdiction. I am an audio engineer based out of Berklee College of Music in Boston, class of 26 (originally class of 25 but my parents unenrolled and forced me on a plane for a year and a half). I read online that ethnically Chinese people can get Taiwanese citizenship. I am of fully ethnic Chinese descent, proven by AncestryDNA. My Chinese surname is Lai (like the current president Lai Ching Te). If I don’t have Taiwanese citizenship, my parents can force me back to my country of origin since my diplomat cousin will help them. My parents had forced me on a plane once, and I don’t want to risk it anymore by holding my current nationality. My country doesn’t allow dual citizenship and if I gain Taiwanese citizenship or at least an NWOHR document I’m already safe because my old citizenship will be automatically cancelled. Please note that I do not have Chinese household registration. I have never even been to china because of the homophobia there. I don’t even speak Chinese. This is literally my only way to safety and I need to know if this is possible. . EDIT: I will be at pride with TECRO New York. My parents weren’t born in Taiwan but in that said Muslim country."

I get from their post they’re trying to make themselves politically ineligible to enter their home country. that way even if somehow forced back, immigration will reject them. getting a green card or asylum wouldn’t cancel their citizenship. it’s a bold strategy"""

For historical reasons, many ethnic Chinese and Mongolian living overseas may also acquire nationality by providing valid documents issued by the government of the Republic of China that verify their parents ROC nationality.12. wikipedia taiwanese nationality law. I’m sorry about your situation. Big hugs. Can you claim asylum here in the US?. """

taiwan,deoxys27,t27x5hburq,t1laxruax,t1laxqr1y,06/30/24 02:42,4,2,0,1,"""Not true. Having Spanish or Latin American lineage does not entitle to Mexican citizenship. The only ways to get Mexican citizenship are:. 1. Being born in Mexico or in a Mexican vessel/aircraft.  2. Being born abroad to at least one parent who is Mexican.  3. Naturalisation"""

You may like to check with Boston TECRO to see what they need. Alternatively, you may want to connect to local organizations that may give you legal help in assessing if you qualify for protection in the US where you are under the ""complementary protection criteria"" ."""

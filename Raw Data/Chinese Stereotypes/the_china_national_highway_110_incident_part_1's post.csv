A warning for the fair-hearted, turn back now if you do not wish to learn of the grizzly details I am about to divulge in this report. The incident that occured between August 14, 2010 - August 26, 2010 on the China National Highway 110 was undoubtedly a national embarresment for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), but the redacted information that Ive uncovered has revealed a dark and chilling truth that I myself have struggled to come to terms with. You have been warned, my dear reader, turn back now if you do not wish to know any further, I would not blame you. For you brave souls that continue reading, I commend you for your steadfast pursuit of the truth, but please tread lightly, and stay safe. The official story reported by the CCP goes as such; on August 14, 2010, thousands of commuters traveling on the China National Highway 110 were brought to a stand still as a large influx of commercial trucks going to and from Beijing bottle-necked the highway, leading to a 12-day traffic jam that has been described as the worst in human history. For 12 days commuters were traped on the highway, not being able to move more than 0.6 miles per day during this period, leading to a humanitarian crisis as commuters were cut off from food and water being unable to return to their homes. . However, in the course of this investigation, I have uncovered a series of classified reports detailing a covert military operation that was underway on August 14 that was the true cause of this disaster. To understand what happened and why, we must first understand the organization that led the operation, the Jiugong Obscure Human Neurology Program, or otherwise known as, J.O.H.N. . Whistleblowers within the organization describe it as a semi-private scientific institute working closely with the Chinese Peoples Army, and specializing in bizarre, esoteric experiments concerning human para-neurology (clarvoyance, telekinesis, telepathy, etc.) and the occult. According to the documents and testimonies these whistleblowers were able to provide, at great risk to themselves, and the testimony of two escaped test subjects who were gracious enough to tell their story, these experiments were nothing short of abominable, rivaling those committed even by the infamous Unit 731 during WWII. What they seek to achieve is still unknown to us, but, through these testimonials, I believe we can paint an intriguing picture of the horrendous experiments that went on in their facilities. Note, all the names of those giving the testimonials have been fabricated for the protection of both them and their families."

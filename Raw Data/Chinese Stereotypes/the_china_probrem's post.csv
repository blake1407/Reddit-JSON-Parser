Many people condemned the cartoonists for disparaging Muslims and Islamic culture. When asked whether it would be acceptable for a cartoon to disparage a symbol/figure of Chinese culture like Confucius, the majority said it should be against the law. . This does not mean all Chinese people think this way. Not all Chinese people do. However, it is an example of what distinguishes the West from many places around the globe. Many don’t get it, they don’t get the joke, they don’t understand the value of free speech, only the risks (being offended most of all). They make no connection between the heinous shit they may say about other countries/people/cultures and the freedom others have to say shit about them. It’s a double standard we shouldn’t abide here in the US. . Here we actually do celebrate diversity, even though lately we seem to be celebrating it too much. But the truth is, we are an incredibly diverse and tolerant nation. . And many places in the Muslim world, China, and around the world are equally amazing for various other reasons, and we should continue forming relationships with counterparts around the world, if and when it makes sense. But free speech is an issue we should unite around; it is not an issue we should ever compromise on. It is the first amendment because it is the foundation for the establishment of all other rights. . This is why I feel South Park is the voice of many generations, champions of free speech and freedom, and one of the greatest treasures to all of humanity, not just Americans. . There, an annoying little Kyle-like speech for ya. Apologies. Go about your business. "

They censored him out and then just did a scene at the end where they had Jesus and other religious and prominent figures literally shitting on each other."""

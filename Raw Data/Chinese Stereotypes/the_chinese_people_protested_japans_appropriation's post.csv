China,SWR1000,t2_kg3cr7v34,t3_1dkwfpq,,06/21/24 01:29,0,2,0.6,3,"""The Chinese people protested Japans appropriation of Chinese territory before the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out. But when the Russians annexed Chinese territory and incited separatist movements in China. When Yuan Shikai intended to sign an unequal treaty with Japan, the Chinese rose up to prevent its implementation. After World War I, the victors intended to transfer the German colonies in China to Japan. This made the Chinese people angry so the Chinese rebelled. Thus the May Fourth movement was born. Under the pressure of the Chinese struggle movement, the German colonies in China were returned to China. In the 1920s, the Russians sent troops into Mongolia to assist Mongolian separatists in expelling the Chinese. Not only that, the Russians also annexed more territory from China. The Russians have supported separatist movements in Xinjiang and Mongolia. However, only Mongolia successfully seceded from China. In Xinjiang, the Russians have sponsored ""East Turkestan"", an entity that intends to have Xinjiang secede from China. . But even so, I do not see the Chinese people protesting Russias encroachment on Chinese territory. Chinas struggle movements only target Japan and Western countries, not Russia. Since the 1920s, Russians have embraced communism. Is communism the reason why the Chinese deliberately made concessions to the Russians? When the KMT was still led by Sun Yat-sen, they advocated an alliance with the CCP and the Soviet Union. Because the CCP follows communism, it is greatly influenced by the Soviet Union. The CCP and the Soviet Union only split when Stalin died."

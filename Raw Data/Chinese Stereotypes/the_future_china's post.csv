ADVChina,OrangeStaplerAlex,t2_4uuzn6z5,t3_1duizjx,,07/03/24 12:43,0,6,0.88,4,"""“The Future China”. I’d like to suggest a new segment for consideration. Alexei Navalny, the politician and blogger poisoned and then de-facto killed by Putin’s orders, had a slightly similar show to The China Show before he was imprisoned (The channel “Navalny Live” on Youtube). In his weekly show, he criticized the regime and differentiated between the regime and regular Russian people who are massively hurt by it; just like Matt and Winston with the CCP. Like the China Show, Navalny’s got very heavy/negative (a lot). Listening to it was hard and I often ignored it or skipped large chunks if I wanted to have a good day. Anyways, Navalny eventually lightened it up a bit like Matt/Winston did with theirs, including with a segment called “Russia of the Future” or “The Future Russia”. There he’d focus not on the problems (alone) but on solutions and how wonderful life in Russia would be when Russians becomes free. He’d then offer practical steps everyday people could take to fight the regime’s BS. Basically, I think Matt/Winston need to turn into problem solvers as opposed to solely problem pointers. Granted, they have 0 political standing and organization in China unlike Navalny in Russia (he had a large political infrastructure and boots on the ground there, including himself). Matt/Winston also can’t (without some heavy lifting) speak to Chinese people directly due to the firewall. But I think by expanding into problem solving on their show, they can offer a lot more hope if only for the viewers. You never know where/what that constructivity/positivity can lead to. Just my 50 cents."

For context, during the US civil war, there was a massive corruption issue on every level. The government had expanded its power and spending by an absurd amount, and was handing out money to basically anyone who promised to give them weapons/materiel. Naturally, every grifter under the sun came out of the woodwork to screw over the Union army. . Congress, naturally, got wind of it, and got pissed as hell. Unfortunately, the government couldn’t possibly prosecute every instance of bribery or corruption that was occurring, they needed a systemic solution. So they got creative. . Enter The False Claims act. It imposed civil penalties for fraud against the government. However, the kicker is that the government wasn’t the one who would prosecute for these crimes. Instead, the whistleblowers could independently file claims against these corrupt companies. And as incentive, they’d get something like 25% of all the money their targets screwed the government out of. . In essence, they turned the grifters against each other, by putting in a bounty system against corruption. Even if someone has an incentive to be corrupt, everyone else has a much larger incentive to turn them in. . And while it didn’t root out all corruption, it did a VERY good job of culling the worst of it running through the Union army. Personally, I think that China would benefit a LOT from this kind of law. It’s such a low trust society, basically any kind of government-mandated anti-corruption measures are going to be limited in scope. Even the CCP has limits as to how many people it can prosecute at once. . One of the best ways to tear the rot out would be instead to turn that low trust society into a self-regulating system. Use that snitch culture to actually improve the Chinese economy rather than just improve the CCP’s grip on power. . ."""

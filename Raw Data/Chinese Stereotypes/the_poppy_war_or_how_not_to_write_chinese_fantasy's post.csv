CharacterRant,lostdimensions,t2_j7qfz,t3_1dmp6cv,,06/23/24 11:50,0,74,0.92,43,"""The Poppy War. Introduction. R. F. Kuang is an American fantasy novelist, responsible for: The Poppy War trilogy, Babel, Or the Necessity of Violence, and Yellowface. She is widely acclaimed for tapping into lesser seen perspectives and histories. Unfortunately, her books fail to actually achieve this, coming off as shallow, incredibly on the nose analogies that do not treat real history with the respect it deserves. This is extremely disappointing given that Kuang holds graduate degrees in sinology from both Oxford and Cambridge, and is currently doing a PhD on China in Yale. Today, we will discuss The Poppy War(2018), Kuang’s breakout novel, a book that is supposedly a YA fantasy novel delving into the dark history of the Sino-Japanese war with elements from the Opium Wars. Spoiler Warning, obviously. Do not read further if you don  want to be spoiled. The Poppy War. The Poppy War is, simply put, an edgy version of Harry Potter coloured over with the veneer of Chinese/East Asian cultural symbols and names, set in the backdrop of a hilariously cobbled together, fantasy version of the Opium Wars/Accords + the Sino-Japanese war.xa0. The long and short of the plot: peasant girl Rin (Fang Runin) somehow mugs 19 hours a day to pass the extremely challenging national exam and is admitted into the foremost military academy of Sinegard (the capital of Magic China: Nikan). Magic China is currently recovering from a war from neighboring Mugen Federation (Magic Japan), a band of war mongering rapists. Rin is discriminated against, kicked out of a crucial class, and becomes the student of loremaster Master Jiang, an eccentric weirdo who teaches Rin shamanism and the use of drugs to access the gods. She becomes friends with Nezha, the son of a minister (if you noticed the naming scheme, well come back to this later), and admires Atlan, a very talented senior whos also a Speerly (Magic Taiwan, but genocided by Magic Japan).xa0. With ⅔ of the book spent doing an academy arc, the book suddenly pivots, hard, to grimdark military violence. When Nikan is inevitably invaded by Mugen, the students are split off into guerilla groups to fight the Mugen. Then we get a whole chapter of basically, Rape of Nanjing: the wiki article. Then Rin and co gets kidnapped by basically Unit 731, becomes addicted to heroin, taps into magic shamanism, and destroys the whole of Mugen via magic nuke. Naming Scheme. Names are a fairly minor part of any given novel. Names are also the first indicator to how much research someone has actually done. In the Poppy War, names and worldbuilding comes off as ludicrous and frankly, silly, in a way that is hugely immersion breaking.xa0. First up, naming the provinces after the Chinese zodiac? Really? Why? (The protagonist, for example, comes from the Rooster Province, ruled over by the Rooster warlord). Its strange. Its an idea that sounds cool in worldbuilding and sounds ridiculous out of it. Real countries don  have consistent naming schemes like this, but rather names develop out of local parlance.xa0. Okay, I hear, this is just fantasy man, stop nitpicking! Well, imagine a fantasy kingdom based on Europe. Imagine if we named the provinces after the English translation of the Zodiac: Twins (Gemini), Bull (Taurus), Water Bearer (Aquarius). Doesn  this sound ridiculous? It would have been more forgivable if Kuang simply kept the hanyu pinyin instead of going the extra mile and writing it as Rooster Province! Imagine if you didn’t just name your worldbuilding after the Zodiac, you also called ‘Gemini’ the ‘Twins’ because you don’t trust your audience to know it!xa0. Second, this is horrid worldbuilding. Place names invoke history; creating a uniform naming scheme makes your worldbuilding flat and uninspired. Next up: Character names. Im just going to complain about two big offenders. Nezha and Master Jiang. Did Kuang pick random slips from ""most famous chinese figures""? Master Jiang is a blatant allusion to Jiang Ziya, and this is at least a little better, because I can see that she took Jiangs character from his anecdote of being an unusual old man fishing at a river. Its shallow, but fine. Nezha? I just don  see any connection! Poppy War Nezha is a badly written (fanon) Draco Malfoy expy (up to and including: arrogant, instant dislike, rivals, handsome, son of powerful political figure, classist, eventually redeems himself); Nezha in folklore is a patron of children, a largely heroic if impulsive deity. I should also mention that character names in the Poppy War come off as incredibly random because of this issue – some names are blatantly fictional; they sound vaguely Asian without actually being any specific language. And then some names are straight up real Chinese people.xa0. Problems. The worldbuilding is an extremely thin veneer over real history. Somehow Kuang has mashed together the entire stretch of history from 1800s to 1945 without blinking and cast the thinnest pretense of fantasy over it. The plot is incomprehensible and seems to chug at a speed designed to get to what Kuang really wants to do - write about the massacre in all its horrors. Except its not even a good treatment, because good historians understand an event is not just about its horrors, but about the personal experiences and lenses that individuals understand the events through. Rin is such a non-character that we don  get that. So we just get torture porn. What is the point of the military school system? Just because Enders Game did it, Harry Potter did it (in terms of boarding school), doesn  mean you have to do it to be a YA Fantasy novel. Its pointless. At least Enders Game was more convincing in terms of how military school and war games shape you into thinking/being a commander. Characters. Characters are bereft of life. Who is Rin? Rin is an incredibly angry chinese teen who keeps making bad decisions. Oh and she has a drug addiction. Is there anything more to her than that? Is this characterisation ever explored in an interesting way? Rin is supposed to be Mao Zedong as a teenage girl (I am not exaggerating, Kuang has literally said this). She nominally parallels him as a poor peasant who takes up arms against both foreign invaders, internal dissidents, and finally becomes the villain to be destroyed. Ironically, thats an insult to Mao, if anything. At least Mao was capable of rallying a force, winning a civil war, and earning the loyalty of the early CCP forces, regardless of what came later. Beyond the first few chapters, Rin quickly loses both competence and agency and becomes a puppet to every other force around her.xa0. Magic Systemxa0. Magic in poppy wars. Opium == magic. Nuff said. To elaborate, in the Poppy War, magic comes via a system of shamanism. A person can access a deity by the use of mediation and drugs, and access their powers. In theory this sounds edgy and cool. Unfortunately Kuang doesn’t do anything interesting with this idea. It just exists as an edgy allusion to the Opium wars because why not! And that brings me to the next point. (Note that in Babel, another interesting magic system revolving around silver and translation gets wasted because somehow Britain still dominates the silver producing China – why? Because otherwise the white colonialism narrative doesn’t work, presumably.). History. Imagine a book like this: you’re fighting Nazi Germany and the main character was a French general who was evacuated at Dunkirk, fought at Stalingrad, worked with the Polish resistance to smuggle Enigma and then got sent to Auschwitz and escaped before getting bombed by a V1 and a V2 at the same time before inventing the nuke which they then used to nuke Germany. Also we somehow compressed World War 1 and the Franco Prussian war into the timeline. Congrats, you’ve successfully emulated how it feels to see history in the Poppy War – every atrocity that happens to China in 200 years can now happen all at basically the same time! Oooh, century of humiliation? Opium? Nukes? Rape of Nanjing? Why shouldn’t we have it all at the same time?. Is this a novel about the horrors of war, or this is a carnival ride/sightseeing tour through every part of the war you can name?. Racism?. For an author who is deeply attuned to racism (Rin is constantly mocked for her dark skin), I cannot understand what on Gods green Earth was Kuang thinking when she wrote the Speerlies as a plot point. The Speer is a tributary island to the Nikan (again, Magic Chinese). They are a race of people different from the Nikanese, and are characterized as mindless brutes whore only good at violence. The Speerlies were subjugated and destroyed by the Mugen (again, Japan), and genocided. In the plot, the Speerlies worshiped the Phoenix; and the main character was eventually revealed to have Speer heritage, which allowed her to tap into the Phoenix and destroy Mugen. Speer is blatantly a Taiwan expy. I don  think I need to explain why making an entire nation a race of brutish but magical orientals/exotics is problematic to say the least. And basing that nation off a real nation is even worse. Not to mention, making that secret racial heritage the key to the protagonists powers?. Conclusion. The Poppy War is desperately shallow for the subject matter it wants to tackle: war, genocide, and addiction. Despite that, it is somehow very popular and critically acclaimed for being an Asian Fantasy written by an Asian-American author. I argue that it is Chinese only in the sense that Panda Expresss Orange Chicken is Chinese -- that is to say, its Chinese in name only, and would legitimately hold up to scrutiny better if it weren  marketed as an uniquely Chinese fantasy. It is a 2.5/5 book advertised as a 5/5 book. Unfortunately, whilst Babel and Yellowface hold up better writing wise, Kuang seems to continue a troubling trend of tackling topics like colonialism without the requisite depth, and is terribly, terribly on the nose when it comes to topics that require a good dose of self-awareness. (Yellowface is a satirical novel about a white, untalented and jealous author who steals the work of her better -- an Asian American who writes breakout novels about her heritage back in China). Well, I suppose if you can depict yourself as the chad and your critics as the soyjak in book form, and still have it sell, who’s going to stop Kuang from writing yet another best selling, ""minority culture"" novel while better Chinese novels remain far from the bookshelves?xa0.

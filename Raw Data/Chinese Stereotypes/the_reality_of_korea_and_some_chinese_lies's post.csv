I am a 58-year-old manager of a small business in Korea and live with my wife, two daughters, and mother. I run a company, but I think I live with a standard of living that goes from the middle class in South Korea. The family is all working for a company, and the average monthly income for the family is about USD12,000, which is enough for the family to live on. . I think the monthly income of these families is not a high standard of living in Korea, but rather a median family standard of living. My company employs foreign workers from Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, and Cambodia, and their average income is about 3,800,000 Korean won. (8 hours a day). Recently, many foreigners have come across a lot of evaluations and opinions about Korea through YouTube. . However, I am particularly surprised by the fact that Chinese people say that Korea is a vassal state of China, that it is a small country and the poorest country in the world, and that Chinese professors are giving lectures and Chinese students are aware of it. I am amazed at how you can talk about Korea with such absurd lies. I believe that the Chinese peoples misconception of Korea is the result of the Chinese Communist Party educating the Chinese people with a level of complete lies that are different from the reality of Korea. It is absurd that most Chinese people have been suppressed by the Chinese governments outrageous lies and do not know the truth. To give you just one example, Chinese professors who lecture on outrageous lies will not be able to match the average income of the foreigners I run. Most of the foreign workers in my company are between the ages of 20~30 and their annual salary is about USD36,000.- Is there anyone in China who earns such a salary?. Considering the fact that workers in Korea are paid at this level, you can imagine how much Koreans are paid. My eldest daughter is 26 years old and earns around USD39,000.- per year.  When you think about this level, you can see how different the standard of living is from that of the Chinese, and it is amazing that they are being indoctrinated and educated that they are the worst country in the world. I think it is a complete lie for the Chinese media to talk about South Korea in a disparaging way. Im not insulting the Chinese people, but Im frustrated that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is indoctrinating the Chinese people with lies that are not true, and the people, especially the younger generation, grow up with the wrong perception. When I was young, I traveled to many countries for business purposes, but I dont think there is a country as comfortable as Korea for people to live in. . We can talk about many things, but what is clear is that we should not be deceived by lies and should always be aware of reality. Good-bye !. "

China,Afterdisappear,t2_e9wv9yvg,t3_1dykotx,,07/08/24 17:28,0,0,0.1,17,"""The so-called KMT-CCP \u200b\u200bCivil War was actually a war of foreign proxies. As the title says. In the 1940s, neither the KMT nor the Communist Party had strong military-industrial enterprises, and they could not afford the weapons of millions of troops. Most of the arms and military expenses of the KMT and the Communist Party came from foreign aid. That is, foreign countries provided weapons, and the KMT and the Communist Party provided cannon fodder. . The KMT was a multinational brand, with German, American, Russian and other weapons, while the Chinese Communist Partys arms were completely provided by the Soviet Union. . The Soviet Unions arms were early German aid to Lenin to subvert the Soviet Union. In the early days of World War II, the Soviet Union was crippled by Germany, and the arms became provided by the United States. The Soviet Union provided cannon fodder, and the United States provided weapons. . So the weapons of the KMT and the Communist Party came from the United States. . Without the acquiescence of the United States, Stalin would not dare to arm millions of Communist troops to fight against the KMT. . The reason why the United States asked Stalin to fight Chiang Kai-shek was because the United States did not like Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang Kai-sheks weapons came from the United States, but he always had to show that he was equal to the United States. At the Cairo Conference, he was on an equal footing with Churchill and Roosevelt, which made the Anglo-Saxons, who were seriously racist, very uncomfortable. So later, Stalin, a half-white man, consciously taught Chiang Kai-shek, a non-white man, a lesson. . Chiang Kai-sheks biggest failure was his belief in Christianity. As a result, he was deceived by his Christian allies. Christianity does not have much logic, and Chinese people who believe in Christianity basically do not have a good ending. . The reason why the United States supported the CCP to rule China is also very simple, just like the United States supported Chiang Kai-shek to fight Japan before, constantly using bad money to drive out good money. It makes it impossible for East Asians to surpass white people. This method is somewhat similar to Chinas ""using barbarians to control barbarians"", supporting one force to fight other forces. The Anglo-Saxons used this tactic against Native Americans and East Asians. . This routine is still the same today, supporting authoritarian regimes such as the CCP and Saudi Arabia to weaken East Asia and the Middle East and ensure that the United States is the priority. . Even in the era of Xi Jinpings constitutional decoupling between China and the United States, the United States largest partner in Asia is still the CCP, followed by the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party, the Korean Peoples Power Party, and finally the Democratic Progressive Party. . Putting aside Japan and South Korea, among the three parties, the Kuomintang is still the party that the United States dislikes. The reason is that the Kuomintangs ideology makes the United States hate it, and the United States does not want a democratic and powerful China to challenge the United States. Therefore, the Communist Party and the Democratic Progressive Party that have de-Sinicized are liked by the United States."

If Japan or the Kuomintang were allowed to rule East Asia, it would pose a threat to the United States. China ruled by the Communist Party would only become a slave factory for the United States."""

Anything good happening is a result of China and more specifically the CCP. This narrative has been expressed by the CCP for many decades. . We get it already."""

From the perspective of the United States, the United States has done a good job. Of course, perhaps the United Kingdom behind the United States has done a more clever job. Such a clever strategy allowed the Anglo-Saxons to gain an advantage over East Asians after World War II."""

They later supported CCP because they want to make sure China is in a state of civil war and unrest. Several successive think thanks for the Soviets and the Russians have stated that united China being a threat to Soviet state"""

So the Soviet Union began to arm the Communist Party. The Soviet Communist Party itself was armed by the United States during World War II."""

It is the Soviet’s strategy to constantly split China, Soviet sees stable China as a threat, not the US, that’s why they asked China to split Mongolia to create a buffer zone. Many Russians and Soviet strategists have advised to keep China split and unstable to prevent the Chinese threat. Your narrative is such a detracts  from history you must be someone from an alternative universe or high. I mean you mention one side had “Russian” weapons, whilst the other side has “Soviet” weapons. Even a poorly trained AI can’t come up with this mindless dribble, unless it’s Chinese AI"""

The U.S. very clearly had a favorite in the Chinese civil war (the KMT), but the U.S. decided to stop funding once it became clear that the KMT could not win their war against the Communists.

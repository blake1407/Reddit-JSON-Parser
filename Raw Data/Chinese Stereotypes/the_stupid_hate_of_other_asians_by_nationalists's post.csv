Hi everyone, idk how to say this but I find it so counterproductive when so many different kinds of asians hate on each other for made up reasons. Like were all asians in the worlds eyes and come from one root. We should not be considering each other different people, just unique flavors from the same shop. And yet instead of targeting western countries and white people who are the real culprits behind asian issues, I see way more posts by asians targeting asian people. Koreans and Japanese nationalists attacking each other and Chinese are one such issue. But another to be completely fair are the Chinese called Koreans and Japanese dogs because the countries are occupied. Like no matter what, calling another person a dog is not going to help your case. Another one Ive been seeing are incidents of SEA descrimination in east asian countries. Its not okay to do anything like that and it doesnt help anyone to be classist. But on the other hand, I do see alot of SEA attacking their fellow Asian people particularly Koreans spamming plastic surgery comments. Its weird because I have NEVER seen any SEAs even mildly criticize the white people that have ruined their countries but whatever. Or what about the inter-phillippines and Chinese conflict where I see alot of really racist stuff on both sides attacking each other. And no to the Chinese people it is not a flex to constantly talk about how there is nothing unique or innovative about Korea and Japan and how everything they did in the history of ever was actually an invention of Chinese culture. Not only is it not true, but its not productive and it doesnt help the case of rising sinophobia. And for SEAs and Koreans and Japanese I see too much dumb counterproductive senasationalist bs about how Chinese people are ruining something or encroaching on something or when none of that is true. And what about Taiwanese and Hongkongers thinking theyre somehow better than mainlanders and calling them cockroaches? Youre putting down other Chinese people for what? Literally the same ethnicity. Nationalism is a disease and I see it being perpetuated on all sides leading more more hate and division. We have shut down such conversations and recognize that we are all one people, East or SEA or wherever we come of one root."

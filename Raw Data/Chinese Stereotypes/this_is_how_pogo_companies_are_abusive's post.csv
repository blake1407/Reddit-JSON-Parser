It was my first time in POGO, The chinese guy discuss me the task before processing my application. And this is what we discuss, 8hours work 1 hour break OT can be 3hours sometimes DAW! So I am a social media manager, they dont have a graphics designer. So multi tasking, i even handle customer service in my first 2 weeks. 12 hours mostly and im in mid 30s. Have kids. This chinese people are abusive, the task are not that so hard not unless they dont have marketing specialist because most POGO what Ive learn, they dont want to spend in marketing. Not ALL but MOSTLY! That is why, if the company fails, they change brand because they are only 3rd party in most ONLINE GAMBLING GAMES. THE MOST WHO EARN ARE THE STUDIOS & GAMES PRODUCTIONS & BANKS IF THE COMPANY FAIL TO COMPLY AML! DAMN!"

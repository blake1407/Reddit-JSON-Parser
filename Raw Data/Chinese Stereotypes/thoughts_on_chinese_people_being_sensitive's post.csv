I do not think Chinese ppl are sensitive, I just didn  know how to concisely word the title lol. Thoughts on the IDEA that Chinese are sensitive. So at work I was telling my Arab coworker about how once, a white guy came in and guessed my ethnicity (I AM CHINESE) and guesses Viet. I proceed to tell him that Im Chinese, he then says how he would have guessed it but Chinese people tend to be offended by that question (I made a post earlier on my account just search chinese on my acc since I can  link it here). I mean I thought it was so ridiculous, I brought it up just expecting him to laugh yk. Then he proceeds like ehhh well sorta and Im like wtf? Like actually what lmao. He tells me how his ONE Chinese friend (tbh I wasn  listening very well lol but something like this) once responded like ""thats racist"" to coworker guessing his ethnicity or something? Or like saying he looks Chinese. THEN he proceeds to tell me (a while back he guessed that I was Korean) how when he initially guessed my ethnicity, he actually just thought I was Chinese, but he guessed I was SK as to not hurt my feelings or something? Idfk. Like why would I be offended if u think Im chinese lmfao. Whats offensive is him thinking so poorly on Chinese ppl to like .  avoid telling ppl their truth abt BEING chinese? If that makes sense lmao? Like wtf is so bad  abt being chinese. I thought it was really strange, idk any chinese (hardly any east asians at all) ppl so I come to u guys for opinions on what even happend"

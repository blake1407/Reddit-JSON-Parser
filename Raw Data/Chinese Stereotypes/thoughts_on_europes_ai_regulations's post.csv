ChatGPT,ahmetcan88,t2_2y16k4dv,t3_1dipojv,,06/18/24 08:40,0,0,0.31,12,"""Thoughts on Europes AI Regulations. After reading the same stuff on multiple posts, I needed to vent. I copied this from another thread and modified it slightly. I needed this for my inner peace to conclude this once and for all. . Not trying to hurt anyone, just trying to vent, if that hurts you, Im sorry, just trying to have a constructive discussion, which is something I believe missing in the EU, people just take offense too easily and theres not enough room for constructive criticism. . I am an American citizen who has lived on 3 continents, including almost a decade in Germany, and lived in Asia and the States for almost equal lengths of time. Currently based in the only free country I ever experienced personally, the US.  -. So yeah, maybe its time to accept the fact that the EU is not a free democracy after all!. Maybe you need to move to a free country or do something to change your regime, not come here to advise people to use VPNs to bypass your autocratic laws like the Chinese people do to have access to Facebook and stuff. After reading all the replies to me, I think the level of brainwashing in Europe is more on par with North Korea. At least the Chinese people that I met didnt seem to support their fascist laws unlike the sheep here. Most of you dont understand the simple fact that if you want to be spied on, you should have the freedom to. What do you want your fascist union to do next? Pass legislation to illegalize BDSM to protect you and stuff?. Crying here for not having access to the memory feature, then in the same sentence supporting the dictatorship that bans it. !? And then saying China is a dictatorship—oh, sweet irony.  lol. Europeans are mostly just a bunch of pathetic brainwashed sheep just like the North Koreans. Good for you that you have your fascist union to protect you from your potential stupid decisions on your journey to become the next North Korea. All you need now is a modern-day Hitler to herd you there. Your level in technology and freedom is almost there, your economy next (actually, thinking of your GDP per capita over the last 10 years, the trajectory is obvious already and its only a matter of time anyway)."

Firstly, I agree that in some cases, the EU does go too far in regulating companies. It should be a consumer’s choice to use whichever company they wish. On the other hand, however, GDPR is a good thing in my opinion because it does somewhat force companies to tell you what they’re doing with your data. Although that doesn’t work in practice, I do think you need to force companies to be transparent about what they do with user data. Consumers can’t make informed choices if they don’t have information, after all. Secondly, your point in regards to “Europe” not being free is just silly. Also, to compare it to North Korea is also silly. You can’t compare a democratic state to an obvious dictatorship in terms of freedom just because you’re frustrated at what the EU does and doesn’t regulate. Third, don’t call “Europeans” brainwashed just because you disagree with arguments they make. I’ve noticed personally that US and European citizens have very different values and beliefs in how much they think the state should get involved in stuff, that’s not brainwashing. Lastly, let’s not pretend the US is more free than Europe. It might be in some aspects, in others, it very much isn’t. Although, thinking about it, this probably isn’t the thread to get involved in a discussion about politics or state responsibility for its citizens."""

This is exactly what I meant by saying europeans take everything offensive when you are trying to be a constructive critique. This is a trend I experienced only in europe.

My relationship with my parents has always struggled due to the language barrier and difference in mindset. They’re very old-school with my dad being the breadwinner and my mum a full-time stay-at-home wife. My relationship with my older brother is okay but being able to talk to him about my feelings is the same as talking to my parents, AKA, hell give me the whole everyone goes through shit so I will just yell at you to grow up and be an adult or compare my struggles to theirs and say it can’t be worse than what they’ve gone through. I dont think I can ever remember a time Ive gone to them and received comfort like other people do with their families. Recently, my dad basically blew up at me and basically said that I didnt have my priorities straight with balancing work and school, and that I am a liar and that I think hes stupid. . While I was in high school, my dad fell into severe depression multiple times due to financial worries and ended up not working for numerous months over different periods. Since then, I’ve tried everything in my power to rely on him minimally for my money. I went through 3 jobs, and each time my dad pressured me to quit, only for me to start working again because he had stopped working again. This cycle continued for the rest of high school, so after I graduated, I took a gap year to bulk up my savings before starting uni. . After my gap year, I found a better-paying job and now work 32 hours a week alongside full-time study and have done so for the past year and a half, something that my dad actively hates. Hes always on me about how I should quit and that hell give me money to spend but after what I went through in high school, its not something that Ill ever consider. Unfortunately, I failed 2 units out of 4 in my first semester of my new degree, which only happened because I got into a car accident right before finals week. I wasn’t hurt but it destroyed me mentally as well as any motivation to study, but my family acted as if I was just supposed to move on like it was nothing. I told my dad about failing and about how the car accident impacted me but it has just made his demands for me to quit working increase. . Recently, my cars been at the mechanic for about a month due to an undiagnosed issue and theyve been actively working on it and keeping me updated. My dad keeps hounding me about when Ill get the car back to which I reply I dont know, theyre still looking for the issue, and he kept going on about how Westerners take too long and drag their feet and that I shouldve brought it to a shop run by Chinese people because they do things better and faster. Ive gone to the same mechanic for the last 2 years and theyve always treated me well. He asked me again today and I told him what Ive told him previously and he blew up at me. This then somehow then went into a whole spiel about how Im prioritising work over school and that he doesnt understand why I wont quit my job if hell give me money to spend. He then went on how basically the car accident was my fault and that I didnt listen to him about driving safely when the accident happened because I got hit by a red-light runner. He then asked me if I thought he was stupid because I wouldnt tell him what was wrong with the car WHEN I DIDNT KNOW but I was in tears by this point and no longer wanted to talk to him because he made it seem like I actively didnt want the car back and was somehow preventing my mechanic or him from fixing it??? . My mum isnt any better, shes a religious zealot who thinks the reason behind all my problems is because I stopped going to church, basically being that I got older and she couldnt force/scare me to go anymore. Being the youngest, I grew up a lonely child and was treated like an annoyance, especially by my brother. The funniest thing is my dad always goes on about how I can come to him about my problems and that I shouldnt keep things to myself but every time Ive expressed my TRUE feelings, it always ends up with him somehow turning it into my fault.  I know I play a part in having poor communication with my family but after what I experienced growing up trying to speak with them, keeping the conversation short and to a minimum is the only way to protect myself. . I dont know, sorry this was a big rant/word vomit that I needed to get out but Im at a loss. Im so tired and my mental health is basically non-existent. "

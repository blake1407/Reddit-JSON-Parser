And a cat I hope hasn’t ran away yet. . But it’s celebrating the intensity of over night fighting for freedom of independence. Think how crazy North Koreans or Chinese people would celebrate for gaining their own autonomy. . We may have grown up with it, but some places don’t have reason to celebrate, and some of them are here celebrating for their own autonomy. . This is the one day it’s loud in WA . Every other day is pretty much no noise minus ambulances for ODs "

The video is about a white woman  that has a group of chinese adults sitting with a mannequin of a young child next to the white woman infront. She asks the audience how they would react if their nephew came home and said: ""aunty i have got a B on my maths"". The audience reacts with a gasp and one of them says something. Then the white woman says lets pretend this isnt your nephew but your son.  One of the woman starts saying why can you play piano like ping ling and turns to the audience and says WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF THIS WAS YOUR SON. And then everybody starts hitting the mannequin "

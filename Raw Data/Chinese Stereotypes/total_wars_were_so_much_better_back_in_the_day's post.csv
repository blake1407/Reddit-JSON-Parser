It was actually historically accurate back then.  I joined during the Rome II era, so I might be missing a few, but here are some features I really liked. 1. The prevalence of pink dyes in the eastern factions in Rome I.  Its well known that the favorite color of Persians were pink, to such an extent that pink dye was actually cheaper than not dying clothing at all.  The removal of those colors in Rome II was a travesty. 2. Attilas God Powers.  Reading contemporary accounts of the time, we realize that historical accounts of him were accurately depicted in Total War Attila.  In fact, razing a settlement back in the day was basically the equivalent of dropping a hydrogen bomb on the region, with the fires perfectly spreading to the edge of the border. 3. Egyptians being proper egyptians: A huge part of ancient egypt is that even until cleopatra, they had absolutely no influence from the outside world, so you would commonly see ancient egyptian warriors fighting roman legionaries with bronze weapons and linen cloth. 4. Medieval armor: Medieval armor usually time-traveled across centuries, and people wore armor from different centuries  .   . Some things I really disliked about modern total wars. 1. The presence of Chinese people: Chinese people are a myth.  Total War Three Kingdoms is extremely historically inaccurate because it has Chinese people in it.  Youre telling me that theres a civilization out there that doesnt border the mediterranean?  Blasphemy. 2. The Empire from the Total War Warhammer series:  Theres no conceivable way that an empire thats not even a proper empire could have an ELECTED EMPEROR.  Utter nonsense.  Also, having gunpowder units mixed in with melee units?  Ridiculous. "

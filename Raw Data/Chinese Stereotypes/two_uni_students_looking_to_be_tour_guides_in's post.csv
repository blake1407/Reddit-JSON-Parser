My friend and I are students at Fudan University, and we would like to offer tour guide services to foreigners visiting China. Im currently enrolled in a dual-degree program in collaboration with an Italian university, while my friend has just returned from HEC Paris. We both have extensive experience interacting with foreigners. Additionally, we both love traveling. Personally, Im particularly skilled at discovering unique local delicacies, and my friend has traveled extensively across China. We are both currently in Shanghai. I am from Zhejiang, and my friend is from Chongqing. If youre interested in exploring Southern China, my hometown is famous for its picturesque Jiangnan water towns, which will give you a taste of the prosperous and affluent life in ancient China. We are keen explorers and really interested in wherever you wanna visit in China. For example if youre interested in Southern China like Zhejiang/Shanghai, we can offer the tours including. 1. Jiangnan water town tours,  with Hanfu or Qipao experiences.  2. Tasting local specialties such as various flavors of sticky rice products like niangao and ciba (my favorite Jiangnan snacks).  3. Traditional Jiangnan street foods like stinky tofu, huangjiu (yellow wine), and shibingtong (pita-like bread).  4. Visits to themed sites such as caves inspired by ancient Chinese mythology. We will recommend travel planning and accommodation booking apps, and teach you how to efficiently use public transportation like shared bikes. We hope to help you seamlessly integrate into the everyday life of Chinese people!  . Looking forward to meet you! If you are interested, please feel free to PM me for contact number! "

TLDR: West and East can now create killer viruses that only kill people who took a specific vaccine, such as Pfizer, Sinovac, Sputnik  . The Covid vaccines did something unique in human history, they altered those who took it on a genetic level, and did so for billions of people per vaccine, in a very specific and distinct way for every vaccine brand. This is very dangerous because it creates a genetic distinction, which can be abused in biological warfare. Basically you can now create one virus that only kills people who took the Pfizer vaccine, one virus for the Sinovac vaccine, etc. The best example of this is China and Taiwan. Obviously China would love to get rid of the Taiwanese, but cant do so with conventional or even nuclear weapons because Taiwan would resist and the rest of the world would intervene. And biological weapons were never an option because Chinese and Taiwanese people are literally from the same gene pool. But with the Covid vaccines that changed, as 99% of Chinese took the Chinese vaccines and nothing else, while 95% of Taiwanese took only the Western aligned vaccines. So if China made a deadly virus that targets the specific genetic alterations the Western vaccines caused, then it could wipe out the Taiwanese population with basically a flu virus, but would only cause the flu in Chinese people. The same opportunity has been created in Ukraine, where Ukrainians took no vaccines or only Western ones, while up to 70% of Russians took the Sputnik vaccine. That means if Ukraine wants, it could develop a flu virus that kills anyone who took the Sputnik vaccine and no one else, despite Ukrainians having 100% gene commonality with Russians. But this risks escalating the situation to the whole world, with both China and Russia developing viruses that kill Taiwanese and Ukrainians, but then also Europeans, Americans, Japanese, South Koreans.  And the Western aligned countries could retaliate, creating deadly viruses for anyone who took Sinovac (Chinese but also Malaysians, Singaporeans, Filipinos, Indonesians, Africans. ) and Sputnik (not as many outside of Russia but still some). And thats assuming Russia and/or China didnt plan this from the start and gave their own people placebos, meaning they would be immune to such bioweapons."

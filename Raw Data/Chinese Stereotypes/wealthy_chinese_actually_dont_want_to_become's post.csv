Again, its a tiny sample, but Id learn quicker by hearing the comments feedback. I met a few wealthy Chinese people due to work. As for my background, as I posted earlier, Im Chinese by birth but not by nationality and havent been living in Singapore for many years until recently. All of the wealthy Chinese clients I met have obtained Singapore residence in one way or another, but few got Singaporean passports. They consider Chinese passport the stronger card in their deck. I asked them why they think Chinas passport is strong, given that no developed countries other than Singapore accept it visa-free. In contrast, the Singapore passport grants access to many countries. One individual (net worth ~$15m) mentioned he would apply for Singapore citizenship, but not at the cost of damaging family relationships. His family prefers to stick with China, watching WeChat daily and identifying as Chinese, despite living in Singapore for many years. Their initial move to Singapore was driven by the local government’s desire for their wealth . This indicates that people forced out of China still align ideologically with it. Either thanks to the strong pull of Chinese culture or the success of the United Fronts efforts. Other clients said Singapore was too weak and China could seize it anytime. However, Singapore remains useful as a go-between for China, as it didnt join sanctions against China and the US doesnt tax Singapore like China. Singaporeans still have powerful passports, but this is only because the CCP permits it. One guy told me its because China has nukes and Singapore doesnt. When I asked why they choose to have Singapore PR, the average answer is something like this: they all know businessmen who moved to Australia, Canada or the US, however, they feel they dont want to live in the turf of  (ocean people - i.e. foreigners). They prefer Korea, Japan, or Singapore. Since Korea and Japan arent welcoming to immigrants and dont speak Chinese, Singapore is the practical choice. The decision isnt about embracing Singaporean culture. Taiwan is excluded because its seen as poor and rebellious, unlike Singapore. On the one hand, it seems the worry that CCP-aligned Chinese voting under CCP influence is not a significant threat, as Chinese - at least the ones I met - dont want to change their passport, merely want PR. But on the other hand, I looked up Singapore has a 5% population growth yearly and has a reproduction rate of less than 1.00, meaning Singaporeans are being replaced by foreigners which in all likelihood Chinese. What do you think? Do you think this is a problem or just the norm here?"

In true fact, it is those who have POLITICAL POWER who will live comfortably in China, and they will also be among the rich because their power gives them the opportunity to be rich. Those who are rich but have no power/political influence are subject to the changing policies set by those in power and their wealth can evaporate overnight. This is exactly what happened to those who profited from the housing boom, invested in Chinese stock or earned a ton from private education. A whole string of policies came that crashed the housing market, private education providers and that caused a lost of wealth across the industries. Lots of investors also lost money from Chinese stocks. The wealth disparity is equally alarming in China with over 80% of the population earning less than 5,000 RMB a month after the covid lockdown ceased. This is based on official statistics collated from within China by some institute. The exit of foreign companies meant an increase in unemployment for graduates and middle aged Chinese and the situation isnt getting any better because lots of people still have unpaid mortgages and families to feed. This scale of unemployment happened in China before in the 1990s and drove a lot of people to run out of the country. Those who have defaulted on their loans (mainly from housing market crash) and have become registered as LaoLai (ie. bankrupt person with poor social credit score) has reached over 8million and may still increase if the current unemployment situation worsens.

I lived in 3 countries in 3 continents including two western countries. When did I say they are worried about oppression? You made that up yourself in your dumb reply. I never mentioned anything on that. I said China is a fucking shithole. Anyone who’s middle class and above is a party member of the CCP. China is a fucking shithole. It doesn’t matter how rich you are. Even if you are super rich, can you pretend you are not in China when your chauffeur drives you out of your home? The fact that you mention the “cheap services and goods” they enjoy, that’s you being despo for that because YOU YOURSELF ARE POOR IN SG. The country itself is a shithole. China rebuilds small area like a miserable CBD business area with a couple of offices and the tourist areas. You don’t need to drive out far and the real China which is shitty ruinous rubble is all over the land. 99.9% of China looks like Vietnam/Cambodia standard. That’s why the chinks of all social classes desperate for US PR and citizenship."""

Loongx Logistics Studio, established on February 24, 2024. . At this moment, international logistics not only serves traditional trade and cross-border e-commerce, but also serves when Chinese people go abroad for further studies, settle down, experience a different life, or need to work overseas due to life. There is an industry that connects overseas Chinese with China, called: JiYun. . Simon has been working in the international logistics industry for 7 years, serving both cross-border e-commerce and traditional trade businesses. He has personally experienced and learned every step from goods entering the warehouse to customs clearance and delivery in the destination country. In 2022, he first encountered the consolidation shipping sector. . In the three years when the demand for market aggregation and transportation reaches its peak, it is a wave for logistics professionals, and also a challenge. It highlights the problems existing in the aggregation and transportation industry, but the market will reward those who solve the problems. . So this year, I co-founded LOONGX Dragon Walk Studio with two partners. . In a market that is becoming saturated and demand is gradually stabilizing, our goal is to provide Loongx users with the convenience of the consolidated shipping mode, while also striving to offer a higher quality cross-border mailing experience, which is the driving force behind our continuous professional improvement. . So I know, the key to going further and more openly in the logistics industry is the ability to control channels!. . How many people have handed over the goods and have no idea when they will arrive, how many people have not received equivalent compensation when the goods have problems, how many people have paid for air freight but received sea freight service, and how many people do not even know where their goods actually are. . We understand the reasons behind this and also know everyones concerns. We can solve it, so we have decided to launch this long-planned project, step into this bustling market, and take on a responsibility that belongs to Loongx. . 2. Mission, Vision, Values. . We promise to be responsible for our words and services, we promise to adhere to only producing products within controllable range, never taking risks to harm user interests due to profit temptations. Let the customer service and shipping costs be equivalent, value for money, making Loongx worthy of trust. . 3. Collection and delivery business scope. Service Area:. Canada, Australia, Europe, UK, etc. (under continuous development). Service Content:. I. Personal items collection and group purchase items collection;. II. Bulk orders for supermarkets and stores (can purchase specialty products from various regions in China on behalf). III. Door-to-door full house moving service;  . . All of the above can be customized according to actual needs for the aviation plan. . 4. Become our partner, join LoongX Dragon Walk. . If you are interested in deepening cooperation with us, whether you are a student studying abroad, an overseas worker, or a Chinese settled overseas, Loongx looks forward to becoming your preferred partner for international logistics. r"

The development of the Global South, BRICS and the Belt and Road countries represents the transition from the old, unipolar world to a multipolar world. This transition is unstoppable and greatly contributes to the global economy. Unfortunately, Chinas rapid development is often viewed with suspicion by the West, which continues to indulge in zero-sum games in international relations and international trade. But there is another way in which countries can engage with one another â€” that is, the win-win approach, whereby the growth and development of one country also brings benefits to other countries. I do recognize that relations between countries can take the shape of competitors or partners. Competition for competitions sake is part of zero-sum-games and, unfortunately, the West has come to see country-to-country relations more as competition. On the other hand, countries that pursue mutual benefit, see country-to-country ties more as partnerships. Chinas economic growth has improved the life of the Chinese people, creating a huge market with increasing demand for goods and services, with the growing middle-income group in China opening up a lucrative market for high-quality Western products. The United States-led West, therefore, needs to accept trade is not a zero-sum game. The growth of Chinas economy stimulates global demand, benefiting its trading partners by providing new avenues for exports. In fact, European Union companies have been capitalizing (and can continue to capitalize) on Chinas demand for luxury goods, automotive products and high-end manufacturing. By fostering trade relations and reducing trade barriers, the EU and China can achieve mutual economic prosperity."

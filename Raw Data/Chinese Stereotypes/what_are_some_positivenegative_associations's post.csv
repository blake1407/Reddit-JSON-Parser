I was watching a TikTok the other day and some lady was saying “….” and this made me curious about various stereotypes of different regional dialects or accents.  "

That mexicans or african americans are uneducated and stupid? Thats what you will think when you hear their accents. . It could be negative or positive, but its all the same as the above.  If someone thinks cantonese people sound educated, they will  cantonese people sounds educated.  If they think cantonese accent sounds uneducated, they will think it sounds uneducated.  There is no firm fact behind these opinions, and any combo is possible-- there is no reason to think it in anyway whatsoever matches the people with that accent. . Many people think harbin accent sounds funny.  Many people think scottish accent sounds funny.  It has nothing to do with the people or real life, its simply because its different from their local one.  I know this isnt the answer you wanted but its the real one."""

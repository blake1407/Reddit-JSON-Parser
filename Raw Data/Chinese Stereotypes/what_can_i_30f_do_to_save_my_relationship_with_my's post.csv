(Throwaway account post)  .   . So, weeks ago my boyfriend (28M) asked me (30F) to meet his friends for the first time (~30M, ~27F). ""First time"" means that it was the first time I would meet these specific friends and the first time I would have been meeting any of his friends, in general. We have been together for almost a year so I was happy to do so. (If it matters: He has only met my best friend, but that is because I am not from the city where we live and none of my better friends live here. He is from here and has lived here all his life.). English is my first and only fluent language. I do not know any Chinese. English is also my boyfriends first language, but he has spent time in China and dated Chinese people in the past so he is fluent. Neither of us is Asian at all.  so I guess there is an element of him being proud to be able to speak this language, despite not looking like he should be able to. I am happy for him that he can do this.   . On the drive to meet his friends at their house, he brought up a past issue I had with my ex that I spoke to him about months prior. I used to date a Russian guy who would often invite me out with his Russian friends and because they were Russian.  they spoke Russian to each other. I, as implied earlier, do not know Russian.  and often felt excluded from conversations. My ex and I ended up fighting about this.  but I ultimately understood his point about it being his mother tongue, and he ultimately understood my point about exclusion and we compromised. The only reason we would talk about it after that would be if his friends, who have no reason to prioritize my inclusion, would just speak to him in Russian in front of me. He would try to pivot the conversation back to English.  So this is what I was used to. Now back to my current boyfriend. On the drive, he brought up the language thing with my ex and said that I shouldn  get mad if he and his Chinese friend spoke Chinese to each other. I asked him if he could try to not do that. Which I thought should have been easy as everyone in this situation speaks English, and only 2 of the 4 people in the group spoke Chinese fluently. The other person knows some Chinese but is some kind of Asian American who is not Chinese (if this matters: the Chinese person and the Asian American person are in a relationship). He said that he would try, but that I shouldn  get mad if it happened since their relationship has been built on language exchange. I said ok. We get to his friends apartment and we say hello to his Chinese friend (lets call him N). The next sentence after I answered N asking me how I was doing, was my boyfriend going into a full Chinese monologue. I kinda just disengaged and went into my phone. N noticed this and started speaking in English. The other friend (lets call her S), greeted me and was very sweet and charismatic. My boyfriend and N continued in Chinese.  but it wasn  so bad in the beginning because S was there. . For the next 7 hours, my boyfriend barely spoke English. N kept pivoting their conversations back to English. I imagine it was awkward to speak in Chinese in a group setting where only one person spoke Chinese. Alternatively, it could have been how they do their language exchange. I don  know. But I felt increasingly more disengaged as the day went on.  It felt like my boyfriend brought up a painful memory, said that he would try to not replicate that, and then forced me to sit through that situation being replicated for 7 hours. I eventually asked to leave.   .   . On the ride home, I got depressed and tried to talk to him about it and he was dismissive. I kinda rage quit the relationship because I felt unheard. It wasn  what I wanted to do because I originally thought we could just talk about it and compromise.  but he was very stubborn. Anyway, Ive been trying to fix the situation but he is kind of using this issue to bring up issues from the past that we both agree have not been issues for at least 3 months now. As I am writing this I think I am having a bit of a catharsis that maybe he just is looking for an excuse to break up. Anyway, is there anything I can do to fix this? Or, is it just pretty much just over?"

As the evening progressed and they kept speaking in Chinese, you should have said something like, ""Since all of us speak English, can we agree to speak in English tonight so none of us feel left out of the conversation?"" If you said that kindly, how could anyone have refused? Also, by speaking up for yourself, you may not have become so resentful as the night went on and may not have ended up rage quitting the relationship as a result, you know? Just a suggestion if you find yourself in a situation like this again - you should feel confident to speak up and state your expectations to the entire group. As for fixing the relationship, you can apologize and let him know you don  want the relationship to end and want to work on improving things. He will make his decision to get back together or not, and whatever decision he makes you must accept. Thats just how it works! Either way, you will be fine."""

Everybody in the room knew that but him. . Think about the disregard for you inherent in this behavior. Think about the lack of self-awareness he must have. Rather than admit what happened, hes dredging up stuff so hes not the bad guy."""

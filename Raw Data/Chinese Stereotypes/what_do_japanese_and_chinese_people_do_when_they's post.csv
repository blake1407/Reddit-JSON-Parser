I know for a fact that they forget. Why? Because they’re humans, and we all forget stuff. I speak Vietnamese and am no longer shocked to find people who don’t know the difference between “som” vs “xom.” If these people can’t remember three letters, there’s no way Japanese and Chinese people never forget their character strokes. So what happens when they forget? I guess when you read, you can use context clues. What about writing or typing?"

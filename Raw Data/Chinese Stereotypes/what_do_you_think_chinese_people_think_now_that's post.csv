People on the same land are connected, but people separated by water are isolated. Think of it this way. Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao people are not exactly in sync with each other. As someone born and raised in Luzon, I know more about people and culture of provinces in Luzon but dont know much about Visayan or Mindanaoan people. That translates to Filipino (for example Luzon) not knowing much about other countries separate from their land (like Visayas and Mindanao). Me knowing about provinces in Luzon is like if Metro Manila is the US, Canada would be Region 4. They share the same connected land so it makes sense that they know each other better than those from tawid-dagat countries. The difference between maritime and actual border is that pwedeng lakarin ang land, whereas kailang mong sumakay ng barko or plane kapag tawid dagat. Actual borders are solid. Maritime borders can be disputed since theres no solid ground to justify your border. Thats exactly whats causing the WPS issue. Still dont see the difference?"""

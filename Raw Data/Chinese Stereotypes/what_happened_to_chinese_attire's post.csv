As the post title suggests, as a non-Chinese, Im wondering what happened to the usage of Chinese attire (or lack thereof). These days I see it less and less, mostly during weddings or festivals but thats about it. Meanwhile traditional Malay and Indian garb is quite commonly worn. East Malaysian traditional clothing is very intricate, but even then, people still wear it quite often. Is there any reason why Chinese people dont wear these casually? Male attire in particular seems to be close to non-existent on the streets, at least from my observations. Personally I think it would be nice to see more of it around. I believe traditional wear is a highlight of our country. I hope that Malaysia doesnt trend exclusively towards western fashion and end up losing all sense of local attire altogether in the future. Id be interested to hear your thoughts on this."

Theyre also not very comfortable to wear, to say nothing of aesthetic sensibilities; which are obviously subjective -- but even then simply by virtue of their uncommonness draw attention to themselves, something that a good garment suited to the occasion should strive not to do. To elaborate, a good garment is one that complements the wearer. Putting aside the when and where it is worn, good, well made clothes are meant to subtly accentuate your physical attributes, and divert attention away from negative traits -- e.g. posture, asymmetry, over/under-weightedness, height (or lack thereof). You should want to wear it not because it looks good, but because it makes you look good. A good garment tailored with that in mind is also comfortable to wear. It doesn  place any impositions on your range of motion, doesn  cause thermoregulation issues, and provides adequate protection against the elements. Traditional Chinese dress does not have such features. Whatever it might have in terms of over-the-top, elaborate furnishings -- fashion to you, garishness to me, perhaps -- it doesn  quite as nearly deliver in being just a practical piece of clothing; a comfortable, versatile garment. And perhaps that is the point, that it is ceremonial dress, that it limits your movement, isn  pleasant on the skin, and tightly constricts or fails to support properly are by design and wholly intentional. Its nonsensical, but we humans have idiotic rituals and practices, anyway. That lack of versatility is not only versatility in the sense that it would be out of place as a form of dress in most settings, but in that there isn  much you can really do with such garments in terms of matching and accessorising, like you might otherwise be able to with a standard three-piece navy mohair over white broadcloth shirtsleeves such that it would be suitable dress for a business meeting or wedding dinner, and still not leave an impression of having the ""same outfit"" as someone else if they too were dressed in a three-piece navy on broadcloth. Not quite so with whatever Chinese dress. An overwhelming majority of those who are clothed in that standard Western dress find it uncomfortable because their clothes don  fit. They aren  good by any stretch of the imagination -- theyre made of plastic, are cut to a standard template, and held together with glue. They also look like shit and do not flatter the wearers physique, but instead showcase and highlight any negative attributes. They should feel wrong -- because they look wrong to begin with. A black single button polyester jacket with 1 inch lapels that isn  even long enough to reach the waistband of a similarly ill-fitting trouser thats more girls yoga pants than suit pairing, on a shiny black polyester shirt thats almost bursting at the buttons from being shrink-wrapped around the torso, with a 1 inch black necktie worn in a Windsor knot isn  good dress. It is a joke, and the wearer looks just as ridiculous as he feels uncomfortable in something so ill fitting. Chinese dress will just look loud and gaudy to most people. Frankly, thats not an indictment on them, because it is just ostentatious, like most Chinese cultures and customs, if you think about it. Personally, I think that ostentatiousness is ugly and garish. I don  see anything aesthetically pleasing or charming in the flashy, bold, bright, and loud ""fashion"" of such dress. I like sedate hues that blend in, I like soft contrasts and subtle accents, I like graceful elegance that passes by unnoticed by the majority, but that is readily noticed and appreciated by those who themselves possess tasteful sensibilities and instinctually recognise style; which, unlike fashion, is always timeless and independent of vapid trends.

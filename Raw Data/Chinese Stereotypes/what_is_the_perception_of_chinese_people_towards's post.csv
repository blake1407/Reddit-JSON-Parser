China,17brian,t2_a971x8ob,t3_1di16bh,,06/17/24 11:41,0,0,0.43,11,"""What is the perception of Chinese people towards freedom and democracy?. I had a very interesting conversation with a Taiwanese girl last week who was telling me about the mainland Chinese exchange students at her university. I asked if politics ever came up or was an issue. She told me that I should not apply my Western definition of freedom and democracy to people living in authoritarian countries, nor assume that every person shares this definition / strives for the same freedom. Mainland Chinese people, having lived in authoritarian empires since forever, do not have a ‘democratic consciousness’, as she put it. They don’t know what democracy is and therefore they don’t miss it, just as it took time in Taiwan to grow a democratic consciousness and many people were initially skeptical after the democratic transition. Most people in China do not feel like they live in an undemocratic or unfree country, and you could not explain to them that they do. Hence my question, what is the perception of concepts as freedom, democracy and human rights among ordinary Chinese people?"

As for freedom, in my personal view, it seems that Chinese society is currently focused on gaining freedom from the international system (particularly from the US since they are the masterminds of the global system). Many of my Chinese friends would love to have a lot of freedoms of the West but at the same time they show an understanding that giving your freedom over to the government can get things done. I also often hear (including from foreigners) that China has to be authoritarian because of the population size otherwise it would be chaos. But with the population declining rapidly, does that mean China no longer has to be authoritarian anymore?! Only time will tell!"""

If they can get things done by making little reports on WeChat versus waiting till the next election cycle, they are fine with that form of democracy. Chinese people on Taiwans concept of democracy is going to vote for every position.  Listening to various campaign platforms.  Having low expectations of anything getting solved. If youre referring to the US version of spreading ""freedom and democracy"" through regime change and war, Chinese people had enough of that post WWII."""

All nations are animated by economic primacy, but the fundamental difference is in the mechanisms applied to natural hierarchies. I call these natural, because they predate democracy, and are a natural continuation of the agrarian revolution when private ownership extended to rent-seeking utility: the establishment of the elite. The mechanisms of democratic statecraft exist for limitation of hierachical advantages, through clear application of law to the Demos, both poor and wealthy, that doesnt work perfectly all the time, as things can be swept under the rug or means like presidential pardons can be used to benefit the elite. But, it is clear application, when it is in the public eye. It gets to the public eye, because media isnt controlled. One might argue corporations control the media, but this is an inevitability of market operations. The distinct feature of authoritarian statecraft is suppression of dissidents and narrative shaping. Democracy limits that. Democracy works around the principle of separation of executive, legislative and judiciary branches; these are all part of the same party system in China. When things dont get to public discourse on account of cronyism, injustice is an inevitability, more so than in democracy. Furthermore, elections serve to make the governing class of poltiicans and bureucrats beholden to the public opinion, that is driven by corporations that control the media, that is beholden to the Demos. The relationship can be argued, whether the uninformed populace is fed ideas by the media, and to what extent, but it is still a more beneficial arrangement as opposed to the stark censorship of China. It is objectively better. Without elections, power is entrenched, like in China. Without elections, the people grow passive and meek, despondent with participation in ruling of the state. The dissidents are culled, while the obedients are kept, their values promoted in standardized education and in media. There is no transparency in authotarian statecraft; while it is a primary feature of any democracy. This is objectively better. The immediate economic reality informs the opinion of a person regarding the governance under which they live. Yet, the rights and freedoms levied by a person under a democratic state are greater. There is more cultural plurality, as there are more distinct stakeholders in any democratic system. A feature of authoritarian states is homogeneity of ideology and culture; they want assimilation, coerced and intimidated to bones. The thing about authoritarian states is that you can never trust the opinions you have are well-informed, because the medium of information through cultural osmosis is filtered by the authoritarian want. It is insidious."""

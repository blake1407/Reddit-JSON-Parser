I’m also interested in Chinese culture. However, the political atmosphere bothers me a lot. I have Chinese friends in Poland who are studying at the universities here so the relationship may be good on the personal level. But idk anymore. The politics discourage me from learning Mandarin and I really enjoy learning it so deep down I don’t want to stop. My question is directed to Chinese people active here: how do you view Poland and polish people? Could you share some opinions in the comments?"

I think many Chinese doesnt know a lot about Poland except its in Eastern Europe. Most probably cant even tell Poland, Belarus, Hungary, Czech and Slovakia apart in a map of Europe. Of course, since the Ukraine war, the region has attracted attention, and some radical Russian supporters might dislike Poland for actively supporting Ukraine. To me, Poland is a Catholic Eastern European post-communist country with a rich cultural heritage and a bright future.  Go ahead if you want to learn mandarin and Chinese culture"""

I guess neither do they have clue that Harbin had a Polish diaspora. It is rare for Chinese teachers to come there, because they think standards of living there are bad like some third world country, which is not true. Their exposure to Poland grew recently only due to the Mordor invading Ukraine with some thinking it is a dangerous country for that reason. Think it like about a Middle Eastern country, there are many wars, but countries like Oman are safe, countries like Lebanon kinda safe. Some know about important figures in science and culture, like Chopin. I saw many Chinese and Japanese tourists in Warsaw for that reason. But I guess the little pinks (Chinese chauvinists, basically) started shitting on the Eastern Europe as a region, because they hate the West and Russia is their ally in the fight.

After Russian invasion of Ukraine the true face of China have revealed. Chinese people not only don  give ABSOLUTE fuck about you, more! Most of the population believes Poland (and the Baltics, Romania, Ukraine, Slovakia, Czechia) is not really a ""real"" country, it is a part of Russia and will sooner or later be. As for the future, my conversation with a 10-year-old kid in Beijing in 2023:. ""Where are you from?"". ""Poland"". ""I don  like Poland"". ""Why?"". ""Because Poland is fascist"". A 10-year-old kid, no joke. The narrative is similar to Russian. I won  get into detail here, PM me if you want to know more, it just pains me the country turned to such an ideological cesspit. People are fine I guess but people are fine everywhere. Nature ? Great, go and travel. Jobs/market ? Going to the shitter. Quality of life as a foreigner ? Don  even start, can  even get BBQ on the street anymore and thats just a small detail. China got very sterile. Everything feels fake, the gvnmt/police control is strict, people are actually MORE brainwashed than in 2008 so you get lucky if you make any friends (remember, Chinese people mostly don  do anything for free, altruistically .  even if they don  realize it, imo its just their nature, they make friends with you BECAUSE, there is barely true friendship there imo, after a while or right away, ""friend"" always expects something in return :).

Putin had a plan to invade Ukraine, change its government into pro-Russian puppets and use it for .  whatever his plans were. Now, in my honest opinion, he consulted Xi on it, the agreement was to not start the invasion before the Winter Olympics in Beijing end. Olympics ended, Mordor invaded. It was supposed to be quick, Putin promised Xi, and he didn  deliver. Now, we are all in a pickle. Putin can  fail cause Russian people won  take it lightly. China supports Putin and Mordor economically because its just pragmatic, they don  care about Ukraine or its people as long as it somehow benefits them (Chinese government is very bad at PR, it is BY FAR the worst PR-aware meaningful player in the world and it seems they don  really care about it. Well, its their choice). USA probably thought: ""Really? We can test our weapons AND not send our troops to fight? Sign me in.

Hence you might catch both friendly voice and antagonistic bark from Chinese. However, there is a lack of the knowledge about Poland or Polish among the majority of Chinese people, please don  mix the ignorance and hostility. Correspondingly, how many people in Poland can distinguish different Sinitic languages like you distinguish Russian, Ukraine, Slovakia, Yugoslav which all belong to Slavic languages? Incidentally, Mandarin is a category of Sinitic languages, which belongs to the Sino-tibetan language family. You are interested in Chinese culture as you proclaim, but if you comprehend the Sinitic languages is the formal name or not. There are no Chinese languages linguistically, only Chinese people. Additionally, I have learnt some elementary history and culture about Poland. 3 years ago, before the Russian-Ukraine war, I read the book ""The Reconstruction of Nations: Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Belarus, 1569–1999"" written by Timothy Snyder. After the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has a statement about it """", which you shall comprehend as further as you learn mandarin.

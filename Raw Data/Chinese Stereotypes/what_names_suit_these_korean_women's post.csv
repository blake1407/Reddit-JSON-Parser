Please state which English names would suit them. . This one above looks like a Rachel. . This one above looks like either a Sally or Lily. . This one above looks like a Vicky. . You will have to skip to 5.27. This one above looks like a Lauren. Id love to hear if you were to assign an English to these North Korean women what would you choose? The reason why Im asking is a lot of Chinese people have an English name as a lot of Chinese traditional names which many people find difficult names."

Lets start to say that I enjoy big breasts like any other cultured man out there. But I also enjoy breasts of all size. However, I see that Seasun is increasing to big bomba pretty much everyone. . Now, I have an idea about the reason behind it: overcompensation. Seasun put little thought at the breast size during 1.0( it was a different time, the girls were all covered anyway), so most of then where placeholder more or less. (Siris, Cherno comes to my mind. They were an afterthought to begin with. And their skins ripresented it imho). . After the switch I can see Seasun overcompensating, the game has been soft-rebooted anyway and now theyre going all in on bigger is better. I believe that given time well end up with breasts size of all kind. . However, thats my own thought as a Western man. I dont know if every girl having big breasts is something the CN community asked for. Since there are Chinese people here, I wand to ask: Whats the consensus on the CN community? Is this breast change something that you asked for or is it something that the developers just did naturally? "

Morrissey is always deemed and joked as like this horrible guy whenever you mention the smiths or morrissey which annoys me sm. Even if he were why is HE the one who gets this label and not the horrible people in the music industry who genuinely have caused harm?. However he isnt even a bad person, sure his veganism and banning meat and things can be over the top thats not enough to warrant the hate.  Now his veganism did cause him to say something thats been wildly misunderstood and taken out of context, what he said about Chinese people was not something he said out of racism, it was something he said out of love for animals just as if someone were to kill my dog I would call them inhuman, saying this does not mean he is racist. There are a few other things that apparently he said but literally all of them I can find can basically he summed up as immigration is a problem, which for such a small country with limited recourses isnt incorrect he has made no mention of disliking foreign people from all Ive seen. Personally I think people just heard some stuff he said and looked at him thought hes not pretty anymore (even tho he absolutely is.) And said some mildly questionable stuff so ew bad, despite the good hes done and how hes not ever done anything bad just said stuff."

Your half-chinese girlfriend does not speak for everyone. I know for a fact that a lot of chinese people have been hurt and disappointed by Morrisseys comments. Thats not just ""me being white and getting offended for others"". It is common sense that being a public figure and publically declaring that an entire nationality (who is btw a marginalized group in the UK already facing lots of racism) is a ""subspecies"" is extremely irresponsible. >For Britain was not a party I would ever support, but they were not ‘regressive’ and people shouldn’t be ‘held accountable’ for supporting them.

(which was not long ago) Young people can’t afford to buy a home due to there being so many people, and their wages are kept low due to an endless supply of workers. That is not regressive. . Except its not just that. Ill leave you a few quotes with sources here. ""The far-right activist Anne Marie Waters left UKIP and formed For Britain after she and her supporters were described as ""Nazisxa0and racists"" byxa0Henrey Boltonxa0and UKIPs former leaderxa0Nigel Farage."". ""Its platform includes reducing Muslim immigration to the UK to near zero, and to ""bring the entire EU project down""."". ""The party has been associated with a number of figures from the extreme right, including the Traditional Britain Group and Generation Identity.xa0In September 2018, the media personalityxa0Katie Hopkins and the writer and political commentatorxa0Ingrid Carlqvist, who has been accused ofxa0Holocaust denial, spoke at For Britains conference."". ""IPSO ruled in favour ofxa0Thexa0Northern Echo, saying that many of the partys characteristics ""are established conventions of both national socialism and far-right ideology""."". . . ""Both Waters and Buckby are steeped inxa0counter-jihad (CJ) ideology, which promotes the belief that Western civilisation is under attack from the supposedly “supremacist” religion of Islam. CJ writing often blurs the lines between violent jihadis and ordinary Muslims who live their lives quite peacefully. Waters has made a career from relentlessly associating Islam with violence and social degradation, and has described Islam “evil” and “a killing machine”."". ""Unsurprisingly, Islam and immigration is a central focus of For Britain, which lists among its campaign priorities a reduction in immigration and the deportation of those unlawfully living in the UK; the imprisonment or “removing” of those who pose a risk to British people; an “end to police prioritisation of so-called “hate crime”’, as well as the “public recognition of the teachings of the Koran and Mohammed”."". ""For Britain’s Facebook account has posted a racist cartoon entitledxa0How Islam is Destroying Europe,xa0created by alt-right YouTube channel Porridge Pals, depicting Europeans (characterised by as a mass of white faces) being murdered by Muslims (depicted as a mass of brown faces)."". . As shown in those quotes, For Britain is not just ""anti-immigration"". It is a deeply islamophobic party targeting specifically muslims. Make of that what you will. >They were also headed by a woman called Anne Marie Walters who has always been openly lesbian so that throws a spanner in your lgbtqrstuv argument. I know about Anne Marie Walters being a lesbian. That does not prevent her from having regressive policies. Ive read somewhere that they had some anti-trans policies, as well as wanting to remove hate crime laws, but I haven  found a source for that (their official website doesn  exist anymore to verify). I admit I might have been wrong on that. In any case, Morrissey is a millionaire old man who does not know or care about you. Idk why youre so adamant in defending his racism. He said some upsetting things, and hes now suffering consequences for that (ppl don  want to support him anymore). Hes still allowed to expess his opinions and promoted whichever political parties he wants. That does not mean I can  oppose him for that, as the things hes been up to go completely against my values. If what he does does not go against your values too, then I have nothing to say to you.

As for the political party, I will admit that I am not British and therefore not too familiar with the details. However, I do know that For Britain is a very far right political party with a lot of regressive policies on immigration, religious freedoms and lgbtq rights. It is also an openly islamophobic party. Morrissey is allowed to support whoever he wants. However, I am also allowed to be critical of the type of policies he chooses to promote, and I think that anyone who opposes the far right should be too. If he was just anti mass immigration, that would be one thing. I might not agree with him, but that is still a valid opinion.

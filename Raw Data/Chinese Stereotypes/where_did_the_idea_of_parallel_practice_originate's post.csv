ShintoReligion,Enbie-or-Trans,t2_j1jd0yvv,t3_1dorqju,,06/26/24 02:19,0,14,0.94,11,"""Where did the idea of “parallel practice” originate? Does it have legitimate basis in Shinto?. Parallel practice basically means you can be a pagan or any other religion but you have to keep them separate. It seems like on Discord the consensus is this, but people are very defensive about it and unwilling to give their sources on this. This is concerning to me because it appears to be an imposition of western neopagan ideas that is being used to discourage people from looking at what actual Japanese historical thinkers said on this matter. An additional aspect people claim is that the gods of all traditions want to be worshipped in the ways of their own cultures and not in that of others. This one in particular is a very complex set of ideas that I have not seen any Japanese sources supporting. I saw one person make an argument against this claim which involved Okuninushi no Kami and possibly the month where all kamisama come to Izumo, but I do not remember it that well. It is obvious that according to Shinto the rites used to worship kamisama are the correct ones, but I have vague memories of Motoori Norinaga writing that Chinese people worshipped their gods inappropriately in Tamakatsuma, which would imply worshipping Chinese deities through Shinto means was appropriate. The most strange thing people say with this is that Buddhism is an exception. This seems particularly strange as it’s the only tradition I’m familiar with that had an explicit condemnation historicallyxa0xa0but there is a bit more to read herexa0. "

But, in the end, we all can only enter dialogue. . I agree. My take is generally speaking, it isn  my job to judge what kamisama want, tatari will do the job for me, so I just need to worry about my own practice, and assume good faith on behalf of others. >Thats interesting. I get it if thats how they feel about it, but then I wonder how theyd feel about Daijingu temple of Hawaii which, along with enshrining Amaterasu Ōmikami, also enshrines George Washington and King Kamehameha I. Such people were opposed to it. Which is disappointing considering that learning about the Dajiingu Temple of Hawaii was actually what inspired me to ""convert"" to Shinto ten years ago and go to Japan, where my first Shrine I went to was Hokkaido Jingu."""
ShintoReligion,Xuanwu36,t2s8aqn,t1las5lq9,t1laq00dm,06/29/24 12:52,4,1,0,1,""". Nice! Glad to hear you were able to visit Hokkaido Jingu to celebrate such an occasion!. >. . the problem I really faced is that the advocates I encountered are very unwilling to explain themselves, and when they did give explanations it was always a theological assertion about deities having cultures. Ooh, okay. Yeah, Im getting what were you saying better now. I agree there are issues with being that committed to this sort of assertion. To me, for someone committed to such an assertion, what is the allowable range of what is appropriate to the deity and who has the authority to decide that?. An example is Phra Phrom, which is a Thai representation of the Hindu god, Brahma (a representation of Brahma in Japanese religion would be Bonten ). This representation has also spread to Chinese and Taiwanese folk religion. In Taiwans case, Ive seen very provocative modern dances with K-pop and other popular music playing done in front of the deity as adaptations of traditions related to worship. What form of iconography is culturally correct? What form of worship is culturally correct? Is anybody going to realistically be able to stop Taiwanese women in skimpy clothing from twerking to Megan Thee Stallion for Phra Phrom? At least the answer to the last one is, ""no."". Over the course of history and as a deity is worshiped in different places, naturally there will be subtle to significant shifts in iconography and worship. ""Religions evolve and change over time as opposed to being ahistorical and static,"" and so while it might sound nice and simple to assert deities have immutable cultures that must be followed, how do you practically determine what is ""correct"" in the complexities of real life? People will have their answers to this, of course. I have my personal feelings, and Im not a huge fan of some applications of syncretism and eclecticism, historical or contemporary. But, in the end, we all can only enter dialogue. I suppose that was a long-winded way of saying I agree ""attempting to create a theological justification for a universal rule"" in this case has some issues. >The main practical thing is that I want to put Shimenawa around a tree in North America. I do not know the full rules around it which makes me hesitant in the first place, but many people claim that that is worshipping a non-Shinto deity in a Shinto manner and as such a violation of the parallel practices idea. Thats interesting. I get it if thats how they feel about it, but then I wonder how theyd feel about Daijingu temple of Hawaii which, along with enshrining Amaterasu Ōmikami, also enshrines George Washington and King Kamehameha I."""
ShintoReligion,Enbie-or-Trans,t2j1jd0yvv,t1laq00dm,t1langd54,06/28/24 23:24,3,2,0,1,"""Thank you for elaborating with your response. . u/Enbie-or-Trans, I suppose a question here is, why do you feel this firm recommendation of ""parallel practice"" is used to discourage looking at Shinto sources?. Well I think a recommendation, framed as something for a non-Japanese person to do to get into Shinto has more potential validity to it. >However, I could imagine some people being a zealot about all this and making missteps even if they are sincere in their intentions. I think this sounds legitimate, however the problem I really faced is that the advocates I encountered are very unwilling to explain themselves, and when they did give explanations it was always a theological assertion about deities having cultures. . My main issue with the idea is that the deities have cultures idea appears quite worrying in its application. Because people will often essentially use threats against anyone who questions it, I see this as anti-intellectual and discouraging people from reading the original Japanese texts. . >I think its attempting to curb unbridled appropriation and the misuse and confusion that can come from that. I feel there are legitimate concerns about and consequences of ""appropriation"". . What is the reason or purpose for your concern?. . The main practical thing is that I want to put Shimenawa around a tree in North America. I do not know the full rules around it which makes me hesitant in the first place, but many people claim that that is worshipping a non-Shinto deity in a Shinto manner and as such a violation of the parallel practices idea. I have an interest in the idea of European deities being enshrined, but Im not a priest and I figure unless I become one, I wouldn  remotely have the level of knowledge to act on this, or engage with this idea properly. I do not currently worship any European deities. I see this as being purely hypothetical, but an interesting hypothetical. >Personally, I think its edifying to look at historical writings and traditions, but I do not think that necessarily equates to doctrine or some precedent to draw on to speculate on what is or isn  a legitimate stance in contemporary practice. Theres the contemporary landscape to consider along with the contemporary traditions that evolved through history to the present. Yes I don  think what Motoori Norinaga says should be taken as gospel. I feel very edified from reading Tamakatsuma, but it is definitely a hard read with many archaic attitudes you have to address critically. >It is really, really tempting to say that you can say “Look, that’s just not Shinto”. However, as I have discussed in my essays, it is very hard to define Shinto, and since no-one seems to have the authority to impose a definition, in general, I don’t think anyone can actually say that. What you can say, I think, is, “That practice is extremely different from all forms of Shinto practised in Japan. Why do you think it is helpful to call it Shinto?”. (At least, you can say that if you have studied Shinto in Japan to a significant extent.). This is interesting. Everything I ever imagined possibly happening I think would still fit with the helpfulness of calling it Shinto though. I feel like this ""recommendation"" if you just treat it as that is probably best for most people in their first five or so years of practice and reading. I see a lot of people online who pretty clearly haven  done the basics at all with Shinto, and come in really misinformed. Im not sure how you would ""count"" the years Ive been involved but it is definitely beyond this point. I recently visited Hokkaido Jingu to celebrate ten years since my first visit. But attempting to create a theological justification for a universal rule on this is a big problem."""
ShintoReligion,Xuanwu36,t2s8aqn,t1langd54,t1lacfckf,06/28/24 04:20,2,2,0,1,"""ADDENDUM. u/Enbie-or-Trans, I suppose a question here is, why do you feel this firm recommendation of ""parallel practice"" is used to discourage looking at Shinto sources?. What is the reason or purpose for your concern?. To clarify my opinion, I do not think this push toward this ""parallel practice"" is necessarily ""an imposition of western neopagan ideas"" on Shinto itself, but rather attempting to impose a guideline on how to engage with Shinto for those who weren  raised around Shinto, don  have local shrines they can stroll up to and worship at, and haven  appreciably studied and experienced Shinto. I think its attempting to curb unbridled appropriation and the misuse and confusion that can come from that. I feel there are legitimate concerns about and consequences of ""appropriation"". However, I could imagine some people being a zealot about all this and making missteps even if they are sincere in their intentions.

Theres the contemporary landscape to consider along with the contemporary traditions that evolved through history to the present. I was looking over some blog posts by David Chart on Mimusubi that I think are good food for thought. If you don  know who Im talking about, then check out the about page on Mimusubi. From ""Can I Convert To Shinto?"":. >Shinto is something you do, and one of the fundamental principles of the tradition is that anyone can do those things. From ""Who Decides?"":. >What about ridiculous cases? “I practise Shinto by enshrining Inari as an aspect of Coyote in a stone circle, and perform yoga while burning a voodoo doll as an offering”, for example. >It is really, really tempting to say that you can say “Look, that’s just not Shinto”.

From ""Shinkō"":. >“Shūkyō” suggests an organised group with fixed doctrines and rules for how people live their lives. Catholic Christianity is a shūkyō. Shinto, which isn’t even committed to the existence of the kami, is arguably not. . >“Shinkō”, on the other hand, is much more about personal attitudes and actions. Do you make requests of the kami? Then you have a shinkō. There doesn’t need to be an organised structure, or indeed any structure at all. It can be just you and your shinkō for a particular tree. Of course, shinkō can operate within a shūkyō, but it can also exist independently. I am not sharing these quotes and blog posts to argue for or against any approach, but its useful to consider some nuances and different perspectives in contemporary Shinto. There is a certain subtlety to a tradition like Shinto. A subtlety that may not be satisfying for some."""
ShintoReligion,Xuanwu36,t2s8aqn,t1lacfckf,t31dorqju,06/26/24 06:52,1,6,0,1,"""This is an interesting question. I am not too well-informed in the discourse around this, but I have been under the impression this attitude is partially a way to avoid certain issues with ""cultural appropriation"". I think the intention is to steer people into learning about a religious tradition on its own terms and learn about it more deeply as opposed to picking things from a religious or spiritual buffet with potentially little thought. I feel as though this may have also grown out of the already existing criticisms of ""eclectic"" approaches to witchcraft and modern paganism (i.e. reconstructionism versus syncretic approaches such as Wicca and Thelema). This may start to get into arguments about what is or isn  ""authentic"". But, these days a lot of people seem interested in avoiding offending perceived practitioners of a given religion and wanting to be as respectful as possible. There seems to be more concern over what is and isn  ""allowed"" and there has been more talk about open and closed practices in circles where some may also get interested in Shinto. That is to say, I personally felt it was, more or less, an ""imposition of Western neopagan ideas"", but Im not in the thick of that, so I don  have strong feelings either way. People may consider Buddhism an exception because of the historical existence of shinbutsu-shūgō  (syncretism of Buddhist deities and Japanese kami). Of course, historically, some would certainly seek to challenge aspects dominant in shinbutsu shūgō (e.g. inverting honji suijaku  (a theory where some native kami are considered manifestations of Buddhist deities)). While looking at early modern writings that may be pertinent to this subject may be interesting, I think what would be more relevant is what contemporary Shinto priests would say."""
ShintoReligion,Nervous-Tank-5917,t2aqt9o1aob,t1lac41le,t31dorqju,06/26/24 04:45,0,3,0,0,"""This does strike me as an idea which would appeal mainly to hard polytheists, so I can’t really relate as a Taoist and soft polytheist who believes the different gods are simply different manifestations of the one ultimate reality which transcends human understanding. But I do think you might be onto to something with western pagans imposing ideas from their culture onto foreign traditions.  Ironically, this idea doesn’t seem to come from ancient paganism but from the Abrahamic Traditions: whose God seems to be very particular about how he’s worshipped and upon drawing a hardline between the religion that follows him and the religion that follows anything else.  Such hard distinctions didn’t really exist in the ancient world, and to a large extent, they don’t seem to exist in modern Japan."""
ShintoReligion,AdventurousIce5035,t2p9xm8fb8,t1laeczsz,t31dorqju,06/26/24 14:09,0,5,0,0,"""Japanese American here. I am absolutely not an authority on Shinto - this is just my own personal feelings and observations. . Promoting yourself as a proper source of information or spreading inaccurate practices is wrong as Shinto is a living faith and has set traditions. You should try to support your local shrine and follow their guidelines. That said I don’t personally find anybody at fault for practicing how they see fit, especially when in the USA where it can be an obstacle to obtain proper tools. Faith is personal and what you do in your home is your business. . Japanese society is much more lax about religion than the west. There is the saying you are born Shinto, marry Christian, and die Buddhist. I have gotten the sense that (at least among younger folks) they don’t really care much about regulations and parallel practice or cultural appropriation. Overall this is more of a concern amongst non-Japanese, like you say, an imposition of western neopagan beliefs."""
ShintoReligion,Satinpw,t21000ja,t1laf1tv5,t31dorqju,06/26/24 16:24,0,2,0,0,"""As far as the worshiping deities within their context thing, imo, its more about respecting the people the practice comes from than any feelings the gods may or may not have about it. Especially with Shinto, the ritual is a very important part to get correct, although as long as youre practicing sincerely (and that includes showing respect to the traditions and doing your best to reflect it) it seems okay. From my understanding of historical practice in ancient Egypt (as I also practice kemetic polytheism), you would worship a god at a temple in whatever style was appropriate at that temple. So if an ancient Greek went to an ancient Egyptian city and paid their respects at a temple there, they would probably do it according to local customs, but if they syncretized that deity and worshiped at a Greek temple they would worship that God in the Greek way. But that sort of thing obviously was different between cultures. I dont think most people in Japan had a sense of religio in the past. Shinto practice was just the way things were done, so it doesnt surprise me that a historical figure would consider someone in China wrong for worshiping their deities in the local style--that doesnt make their observation correct or respectful of Chinese culture, though. I still think you could probably more safely worship deities from a dead religion in a Shinto way than worshiping a Kami in a way that isnt Shinto, but I still sort of dont like it. Not for a the gods dont like it way, but because, at least for me, its important to learn and respect the religious concepts within various faiths that their deities were born from. It doesnt make much sense to me to worship, say, Heru sa Aset without understanding the concept of Maat and isfet or the cosmology that those deities belong to. . (That sentiment in and of itself is something a lot of neopagans take issue with anyway. Most neopagans I know have no problem mixing and matching pantheons, which includes taking the Kami completely out of their context and treating them like Wiccan deities. Every religion has their cultural context. While it may not be as problematic to do that with dead religions because they dont have a culture to answer to, I still want to be respectful of them.)"""

As you mentioned regarding Motoori Norinaga, most significant Shinto scholars, most prominent in the Tokugawa period such as Yamazaki Ansai, Yoshida Kanetomo and later prominent Kokugaku scholars such as the aforementioned Motoori Norinaga, Hirata Atsutane (though he used christian sources), Kamo no Mabuchi and other prominent figures were effectively exclusivists. If scriptural and scholarly context is used, parallel practice can be considered an ""imposition of neopagan ideas"", although its important to take the fact that the contemporary use of Shinto as a primarily ritual practice may contribute to such attitudes. Shinto cleansing, celebrations and ritual have existed in complement to varying prevalent Buddhist sects throughout their existence in the prevalence of Ryobu Shinto theological concepts."""

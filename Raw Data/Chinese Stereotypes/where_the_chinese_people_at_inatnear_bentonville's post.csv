Ill be visiting Bentonville shortly and Im a white guy that speaks Chinese. Whenever I travel, I try to find the places with the highest population of Chinese speakers to talk to. Sometimes I luck out and find little chinatowns that I never knew about, other times I just find some Chinese restaurants that are family owned and speak Mandarin. Either is fine. Any recommendations of where I can go to talk to people in Chinese? Thanks!"

My wife is Chinese  but we don’t run into many Chinese speaking people here to be honest, even the university does not seem to have many Chinese compared to most other state universities.  If you are ever in Springfield MO I’d recommend Corner 21, both to speak Chinese and also because it’s some of the best authentic Chinese in the Midwest."""

My counterparts are Chinese are looking for local real estate so if you hold out for a few months you may have more opportunities to strike up a conversation."""

Many Walmart associates have international backgrounds and I know a few white folks that speak mandarin. The thing is, they won’t tell you that because nobody would be asking. That’s likely your situation."""

We can assume a few of them, but not all.   . The most obvious one is the United North American States (Canada, Mexico and USA). It is an obvious founder since one of its main headquarters (the one in ME3 prologue) is located there. The second one is the European Union. Since one of its main bases is located in London (when the game was launched, the UK was still parte of the EU), its safe to assume it is one of the founding members. It also has a base in a multiplayer map (Firebase London). The third one is the Chinese Peoples Federation. We know very little about it, but we are certain it is one of the founding members since it pledged colonization rights over the planet Watson, and the System Alliance was formed by all the countries that had some capacity to operate/colonize outside Earth. The fourth and last one is Brazil. The Interplanetary Combatives Academy (N7 training program) is located at Rio de Janeiro. The Alliance also has a bootcamp located in Macapá (the only regional capital located on the Equator line), where Shepard trained. It also has a base in a multiplayer map (Firebase Rio).   . What other countries do you think that forms the Systems Alliance? India, Russia and Japan are pretty obvious contenders too on my opinion."

So yeah, the big players would be the UNAS, EU and China. Then Brazil are definitely there too, and agreed on India, Russia and Japan. That makes seven. . As for the others, I looked at countries with the highest GDP in the world. Of those not in the EU or UNAS in the top 25, that would include countries like Australia, Indonesia, Switzerland, Norway, Argentina and Saudi Arabia. All those with the previous gives 13. Add in Ireland who I dont think would like to be in a super state given their history would be 14. Slightly lower down, but I can definitely see New Zealand being there, as well as Egypt, with places like the UAE and Israel filling out the list. Where headcanon comes in is that I was interested in creating another super state, so combined Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia into the South Asian Union to fill out a spot. I also did some rough maths in the past and those 18 have something like 65% of the world’s population in them and 85% of the GDP."", subredditid: t52rc19, approvedatutc: None, authorisblocked: False, commenttype: None, awarders: , modreasonby: None, bannedby: None, authorflairtype: richtext, totalawardsreceived: 0, subreddit: masseffect, authorflairtemplateid: 6d68e546-06af-11e7-ab9d-0e87129d66e6, likes: None, replies: , userreports: , saved: False, id: ldnlcl7, bannedatutc: None, modreasontitle: None, gilded: 0, archived: False, collapsedreasoncode: None, nofollow: False, author: BobJenko, canmodpost: False, createdutc: 1721243160.0, sendreplies: True, parentid: t31e5omtv, score: 5, authorfullname: t2qh8wcrd4, approvedby: None, modnote: None, allawardings: , collapsed: False, authorcakeday: True"""

In fact, I would assume programs without launch capability would be more eager to sign on than those with launch capability. I could see UNOOSA chairing the summit, and then the other space agencies signing the charter. Even the ones whove historically been averse to international collaboration would probably sign, because the choice would really be to join or be last and irrelevant in every scientific discovery for the rest of time."""

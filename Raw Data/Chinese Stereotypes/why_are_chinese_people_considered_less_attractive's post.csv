The Scandinavian look seems to be considered attractive in Japan. On the other hand, why do locals in Japan and S.Korea find Chinese people less attractive on the outside? In Europe, I have never heard of Scandinavians finding Anglo Saxons and Germanic people less attractive. . Why is this happening in East Asia?"

I am not sure if Koreans think that way.  Some people in these countries may think of Chinese as from a poorer, less developed country, even though the Chinese economy is so big and China is militarily and politically more powerful on the world stage.  It could be left over from attitudes about Chinese poverty from decades ago. Realistically, if you showed Korean men very beautiful Chinese women, they probably would not look down on them for their looks. Also keep in mind that South Koreans fought a war with Communist North Korea, China, and Russia decades ago.  Koreans have long memories about past national offenses (especially on the part of Japan).  Maoist Communism is at odds with the national philosophies of Japan and South Korea.  This is a salient point for South Korea which shares a border with North Korea."""

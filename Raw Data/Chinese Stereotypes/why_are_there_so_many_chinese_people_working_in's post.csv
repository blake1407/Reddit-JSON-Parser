Ive noticed a huge amount of Chinese people working mainly in restaurants in Brazil, not only in Rio but also in many other cities. I wonder why theyd leave China for South America? Generally speaking, isnt China more developed than Brazil? Also, arent the Chinese main cities much more economically diverse than Brazil? Why do the Chinese leave their countries to work in restaurants in Brazil? I dont understand. "

Don’t know if you’ve heard much about China lately, but their m/f demographics are quite unbalanced due to decades of the one child policy. . If a lot of these Chinese nationals are men, and they aren’t working in the mining or tech industry, perhaps they’ve got a taste for fat juicy booties."""

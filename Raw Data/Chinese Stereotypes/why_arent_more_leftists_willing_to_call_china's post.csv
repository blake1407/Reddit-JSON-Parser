China, with its re-education camps and subjugation of minorities, is essentially an ethnostate for the Han Chinese people. Their economic agenda is built around furthering the interests of the nation first and foremost. Its not for the interest of the working or to create a utopia or to let free markets dominate the country. Like Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, they have a mixed economy that prioritizes the national agenda. Also, their debt trap foreign policy, their wolf warrior diplomacy, their hostility towards Taiwan, and their call for a Chinese uprising against the Western order to rectify the century of humiliation all all showcase Chinas nationalist tendencies. Combine those nationalist tendencies with a totalitarian government that uses expansive surveillance to crack down against dissent, and I don  know why its not common norm to call China fascist. Nazi Germany called itself ""National Socialist"", not fascist. The fascist label was given to them by historians. China, calling itself ""Socialist with Chinese Characteristics"" should fall in the same boat. However, I do concede that maybe China isn  fully fascist in the same way as Nazi Germany due to lacking a true central dictator. But Xi Jinping is close. However, leftists in America and in Europe still don  see China as the ultimate enemy. Either because they see China as an anti-imperialist bastion fighting against the evil west, or they still falsely believe China can achieve a socialist dream. The irony is that China is just as expansionist and imperialist as the West, and their social hierarchy is more rigid and inequal than capitalist western nations. Chinas sole labor union, the ACFTU, exists as a CCP vessel to promote social stability and class collaboration, rather fight for workers rights. This is exactly how fascist countries dealt with labor relations. "

Today were hearing that Russia is causing Americans to doubt Bidens mental capacity.  Im not joking.  They told us Russias invasion of Ukraine was unprovoked.  Do you accept that?  This is the treatment of US enemies. Before destroying Libya we were told that this country with the highest life expectancy on the African continent was a horror show for the people.  Qaddafi had rape rooms to punish his victims.  Do you believe that?  Do you believe Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction?  Do you believe that Iraqi soldiers were taking babies out of incubators and leaving them to die on the floor in Kuwait?  Amnesty International believed it and propagated this belief.  Do you believe them. Do you believe Hamas beheaded 40 babies in Israel, cooked babies in ovens, and mass raped Israeli women?  Does this not get old at some point?  I just find it baffling that people still believe western allegations about enemies of the US when the evidence is thin to non-existent. China and Taiwan are not separate countries.  Taiwan has been part of China since before the US existed.  Even the Taiwanese constitution recognizes that there is only one China.  But it claims that the rightful government of all of China, including mainland China, is in Taipei.  China is not hostile to Taiwan.  It is hostile to the US turning Taiwan into a military base from which China can be attacked and its trade disrupted.  China is not self sufficient in terms of energy and it knows the US can disrupt it severely by blocking shipments that travel via the Taiwan Straight. I would not call China fascist because it is the worlds leading socialist country.  Raising the productive forces as rapidly as possible through government planning.  This is the core of Marxism.  It is the raised productive forces that enable equality, prosperity, and freedom for all.  The US is threatened by this because the US wants the world to be dominated by the profit motive.  This is the entrenched US system.  Those in power of course prefer to remain in power.  China through peace and trade is raising the standard of living for poor countries.  The US keeps Africans as subjects, China lifts them up.  Prosperity for poor people is a great threat to the US empire.  It ends cheap labor and cheap resources.  It threatens US oligarchs.  China is the bulwark against American fascism, just like the Soviet Union was during WWII.  So I wouldnt treat them as the enemy because they are building the world up while the US tries to tear it down.  Even today the US is destroying Ukraine and Gaza.  Two nations obliterated.  China hasnt been at war in 40 years.  China is the hope of the future, the dying US empire wants to hold that future back to cling to profit just a little longer.  But I believe the world will move forward and organize for human well being rather than profit, and socialism in China is what is making this possible."""

Once I was at the banmian stall and the Chinese customer dont even know how to pronounce Chinese words properly. Damn disgraceful , Chinese people more likely to be proud to be bad in Chinese while at least Malay and Indian people will more likely say their mother tongue like its their first language."
SingaporeRaw,KoishiChan92,t227pqace0,t1lcbpiro,t31dyxjih,07/09/24 05:02,1,7,0,0,"""Mandarin is not most of our families natural mother tongue.  it was the ""mother tongue"" forced upon us because LKY wanted to standardise all the Chinese ppl in SG because he believed it would make us more attractive to do business with China (although there was a rumor that he also didn  like his own mother tongue). . Many people didn  grow up in households that spoke mandarin but spoke other dialects instead. But because of this a lot of households defaulted to just speaking English. So end up with a lot of ppl whose Mandarin CMI because learn in school but never use anywhere else."""

Both our national language and official language has no Mandarin too. If they want to speak it so much, they can go elsewhere like mainland or Taiwan so they can speak Mandarin everywhere. The fact of the matter is we are citizen of a country and our ethnicity should be second to our nationality. . Not in the days where people segregate and only mix with people of the same race anymore. And OP should be ashamed that we Chinese cannot speak Malay while so many overseas Chinese can speak the language of their country and adopt names and culture of the people who were kind to adopt their forefathers."""

Kidding - but for real tho, some families are English speaking and Chinese is just really hard. While I’m mid at conversational speaking, I can’t write or read. Not that I’m proud but since sec school (over 10 years ago), I don’t write or read Chinese often enough."""

It is a pity that more and more Chinese dont speak Chinese dialects but its not a pity when they dont speak Mandarin. . Mandarin is a Beijing dialect, btw. It was standardized across China as a national language. We are all forced to learn Mandarin in school during LKYs time and the use of dialects was frown upon. . I mean, Im bad at Chinese but I still speak in Mandarin and Cantonese, though not really good at them. Does that make me white-washed? No lor!"""

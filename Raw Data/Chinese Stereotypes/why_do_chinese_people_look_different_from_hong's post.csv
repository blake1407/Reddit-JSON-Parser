I watch a lot of Chinese and Hong Kong movies and I notice that despite Hong Kong actors being of Han descent, they look different from Chinese people. They typically have darker skin, different eye shape, facial features. Why do people from China look different than people from Hong Kong?"

I wouldnt say they really look different though. There is huge diversity within the Han identity.xa0"""

Most Hong Kong people originate from the neighbouring Guangdong Province. The average Han Guangdong person is going to look different to the average Han Harbin person.   . ""Han"" is more of a cultural group."""

Unfortunately, the majority of people do not look like celebrity actors.

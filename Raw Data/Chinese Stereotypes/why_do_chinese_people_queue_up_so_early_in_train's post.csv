travelchina,talon1580,t2_12lt8vv8,t3_1dnxloz,,06/25/24 00:36,0,1,0.56,33,"""Why do Chinese people queue up so early in train stations?. Bit confused on this one given the general lack of queuing. Whenever Im waiting for a train, most people will queue at the ticket barrier a full 10-15 mins before theyre open. . But it seems the majority of people have an assigned seat, so I dont understand why? "

In this environment, people developed a tendency to scramble for scarce resources. Even though a long time has passed, the remnants of this culture still exist everywhere. For example, people like to queue early, and there are often instances of people cutting in line."""

travelchina,ObviousSize4759,t212nrdapo3u,t1labbyr9,t31dnxloz,06/25/24 23:53,0,1,0,0,"""Although there are assigned seats on the high-speed train, some people prefer to board early to sit in their seats and rest. If they end up at the back of the boarding queue, they might face longer lines inside the train because many passengers need to place their luggage on the racks. This means those at the back have to wait longer. Another reason is that Chinese high-speed trains are always punctual, arriving and departing on time. So, arriving early to queue up is normal to avoid missing the train. I think this is a common practice. When waiting for trains in Europe, its the same, but Europe doesnt have such a large population. In China, with its large population, maintaining order is necessary."""

In my parents era, many people had to queue at the ticket office of the railway station for a night or even a week to buy tickets. In such a huge and deeply divided country, the genes of the era of scarcity have not disappeared. In comparison, time is the least valuable thing, and queuing is the simplest way to ensure that a person realizes his various rights and interests, from buying groceries to seeing a doctor, and even getting the qualification of kindergarten or cemetery.

I live in a city with lots of Chinese people. The parks are literally full of old Chinese people that stare at you in between the two sets of hanging off bars and rubbing themselves on bars/ poles. Are they imagining me naked or something? The funny thing is they have no expression on their faces and still stare if you try to stare back at them. "

When you are old, you don’t give a flying fuck what peeps think of you. So they stare at their hearts content. At least that’s my theory."""

AskAChinese,SuLiaodai,t25q6g4,t1latg75n,t31dr7xy3,06/29/24 07:25,0,4,0,0,"""If youre foreign, remember that they grew up in a time with no foreigners, then foreigners basically disappeared from 2000 to the middle of 2023, and now theyre slowly trickling back.  Even as a foreign person myself, Ive had moments of being like, ""Wow!  A Black person!"" (because I think I only saw one from 2000 to mid-2023) or ""Wait?  Are those people really speaking Spanish?  Theyre foreign!""  . Staring got a lot less common as the number of foreigners increased in China after 2000, but I think so many left during COVID that people aren  used to seeing us anymore.  For example, pre-COVID, most of the college students I taught from big cities had had at least one foreign teacher in high school, but post COVID, almost none of them have."""

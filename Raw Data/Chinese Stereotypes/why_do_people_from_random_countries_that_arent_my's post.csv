I’m learning Japanese, my display name is written in Japanese katakana, my profile description is in Japanese. But for some reason, I keep getting people from countries that aren’t Japan messaging me. Usually, they’re from either India, middle eastern countries, Eastern Europe, or Southeast Asia. . I don’t want to be mean, but I just don’t see a point in talking to people with who I have no interest in learning their language. It seems like a waste of time for both of us. What’s kind of funny is that in my profile, I’ve said I also want to study Korean and Chinese, yet Korean and Chinese people never message me lol "

Demand is much higher than supply. You don’t have to respond though. I never get responses from people I text to even when my native language is among those that they “learn”"""
HelloTalk,LucyLu,t2y59v5d1yi,t1lak6do6,t31dpw42z,06/27/24 14:25,0,6,0,0,"""As a Japanese learner I have exactly the same issue and number of messages from those profiles is a bit annoying. Even if they do want to learn my native language (which I highly doubt) it makes no sense that theyre contacting me in the first place since there would be no mutual benefit from that communication. I just ignore them."""

Joke aside, Im Japanese and Im also getting messages from those who dont even speak my target language (Español). Many of them are Japanese learners so my presumption was that they dont get that many Japanese people learning their language so decided to contact whoever Japanese on the platform. Some even leave messages in English to my Spanish Moment posts which is annoying as Im living and working in an English speaking country and have absolutely no interests in English communication there. I stay nice with them but keep my interaction minimal."""

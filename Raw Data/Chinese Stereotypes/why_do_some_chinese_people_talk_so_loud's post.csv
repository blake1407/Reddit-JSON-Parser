When in smaller 2nd and 3rd tier cities, and this especially applies to older citizens, the volume of conversations increases. . I’ve always put it down to China being an incredibly loud country overall. Fireworks at celebrations, loud speakers blasting for attention in food streets, music pumped in lifts and shopping malls, noisy  restaurant dinners, it all contributes to an environment where peace and quiet isn’t prioritised. Why talk quietly when there’s noise all around?. Put simply, when silence isn’t valued, what’s the incentive to speak quietly?"""

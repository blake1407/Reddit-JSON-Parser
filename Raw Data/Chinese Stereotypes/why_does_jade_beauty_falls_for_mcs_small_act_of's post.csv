So I may have figured out the answer to this question . So I was reading this novel  (Jin Ping Mei/ The Golden Lotus) written under the pseudonym Lanling Xiaoxiao Sheng , ""The Scoffing Scholar of Lanling,"" during the latter half of the 16th century during the late Ming dynasty (1368–1644). In chapter 3 titled ""The Old Procuress"" in the english translated version. There is a line by the author whoch goes as . It would seem that in all the world there is not a single woman, no matter how intelligent she may be, who cannot be led astray by some trivial act of kindness. Nine women out of every ten are caught this way. So it seems chinese authors portraying the Jade beauties as they do, is not due to their ignorance or self wish fulfillment. But even hundreds of years ago chinese people thought the same, that women can be led away by some trivial act of kindness. Going by this logic we can see why Jade beauty/ies fall for Mc, even though the young master has poured all his heart, and wealth to her. Well, I wonder if there are ladies in this group. If there are I would like to ask do you guys really like some small act of kindness that much that, you would just ignore a person that just pours his whole heart for you honestly???? Man, if this true, one more question, why? Just why?. Edit: The novel I mentioned is supposed to be one of the classics of medieval chinese literature. A saga about ambition, murder and lust. Im just at chapter 5, so I don  know how I feel about this. !!"

I am just a senior that has found someones teachings and are relaying things to others, what your comprehension finds is what your heart truly speaks. If Junior saw the dao of incel and not the attempts at understanding the dao of interactions, the difference between yin and yang, then this speaks high of what Junior thinks. . (Actually, I dont know where you thought I was justifying trash novels lmao, I was just explaining the chart)."""

The ""Bad Boy"" traits corresponds to your looks, appearance, body, etc. as well as general masculine qualities (like assertiveness, power, dominance, influence, confidence, and the dark triad (can be on how dangerous you are)). A maxed out Bad Boy trait without the Good Boy traits lands you at the ""wil be laid, but will not be dated"" because the chart says females finds these traits appealing to their lust. You will be a good fling, but not an ideal long term partner. The ""Good Boy"" traits corresponds to how much you spend on them (resource and time wise) and how presentable you look when people see you are both together (imagine this as how much agreeable you are to be presented publicly and acknowledge as associated with her). This doesn  apply to chinese MCs, but this trait also says that the less female you also invest in, the better. A maxed out Good Boy trait without the other trait lands you at the Friend Zone (which we dont want) and this is why the advice to just be nice doesn  work. If you are just being nice without any BB trait that she has acknowledged, you are nothing but a Simp. You will be a good friend, but she will never sleep with you. So, to be the ideal long term man in a womans eye, you have to max out both. Theres more nuance to it, but thats basically it. For the male zones, its on the left side (which only operates in one axis, and this is what confuses males when trying to figure out how females work, because they can  fathom that you can be a ""Bad Boy"" and ""Good Boy"" at the same time)."""

Imagine giving an advice of ""Just be Nice"". I would admit though, MCs of Wuxia do actually fulfill the female sense of attractiveness in my opinion. . If hoe math is to believed, almost every chinese MC actually falls into Prince Charming category because they just tick out all the boxes in both the Bad Boy and Good Guy axis. They have good looks, theyre pretty masculine, they invest their time and money to the girl, theyre presentable to be with, etc. Young Masters fail at the masculine part, because theyre pussy bitch boys that the Jade Beauty can beat. They fall too much on the Ick/FriendZone tbh. The Young Masters aren  mysterious and indifferent enough to the Jade Beauty that they just come out looking like Simps."""

And people don  often talk about it, but 99% of the JB are also materialistic af. Theyre interested in mc because hes different as in good looking/strong/""mysterious""/talented  (aka having cheat, being the only teenager among a school of children). Look and behold, something that certain young masters also have an conveniently. . The JB are suddely are ok with being part of mc harem, which they detest when the young master did that. Why?

There was no real expectation that a marriage should be based upon mutual emotional satisfaction. There wasnt anything like dating really. So small acts of kindness would really go a long way. This was observed in the Western realm as well. As the master Giacomo Casanova had remarked, the key of seduction is not in doing anything grandiose or special, but simply by being attentive and generous, There is no honest woman with an uncorrupted heart whom a man is not sure of conquering by dint of gratitude. It is one of the surest and shortest means. Beside, is it not like a frog in the well to look down on these people as backward, when in our own time, there was--and arguably still is--a very prevalent sentiment that the man should pay for dinner to obligate the woman into repaying that favor?"""

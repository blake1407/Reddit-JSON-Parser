So a few times now I’ve found myself in a Chinese restaurant or grocery store and I’ve asked for something that contains Sichuan/Szechuan heat. I love the flavour and the numbing heat sensation that the peppercorns give, and I look for any opportunity to have it either at home or eating out. . But each time I’ve asked I’m met with confusion about what exactly I’m asking for. I must assume then that there’s either another name for it, or it’s not as well known as I thought. Or I’m pronouncing it so horribly (pretty much phonetically I’m guessing?) that it’s unintelligible. Either way I’m left feeling a bit silly without what I’m looking for. . Please help! "

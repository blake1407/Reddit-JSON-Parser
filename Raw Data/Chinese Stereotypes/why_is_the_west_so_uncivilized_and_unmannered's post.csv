Ive addressed this topic many times on different sites and forums but I can  help but point out how much of a discrepancy I found when I lived in East-Asia like Japan and compared that to the West. Even though all countries have pros and cons and Japans society is BY FAR not perfect, at the very least, people will usually leave you alone and they mind their own business. They keep their streets clean and behave in a well-mannered fashion (unless theyre extremely drunk). Usually, its the many Westerners and a significant portion of Chinese people who cause turmoil with their selfies and loudness. . Its very natural there to keep your mouth shut when traveling in a train and people show basic respect and consideration towards other people. In Europe and the US, I don  find this anywhere. Streets are usually filled to the brim with trash. There is an abundance of loud, edgy teenagers lurking around, behaving like apes. People usually seem like theyre always in a bad mood and the customer service is also quite bad. You have all these annoying Tiktokers and trouble-making streamers like Johnny Somali, Ishowspeed, Logan Paul etc. whose presence cause turmoil and discomfort. People lack basic hygiene and there are so many obese people. People are loud in trains and leave all their trash there, its honestly repulsive. Trains don  even arrive and depart on time. Your typical Westerners mindset is all about individualism and self-expression which causes a lot of disharmony in society. They do not have a common cultural denominator to rely on because of the forced diversity and the mixing hotpot of so many cultures at once. People don  make place for others to leave the trains and are instead trying to push themselves in like animals. There is no sense of consideration, respect, manners or anything because everyone is so arrogant and self-absorbed because of this individualistic mindset that the West so heavily leans on. The younger generation Z in the West consist of extremely obnoxious, loud and rude people who support equally immature streamers who molest people publicly. I don  see any of this behavior in Japan. Even the ""rude gangsters"" there have more manners than most of the current Westerners. . I think that the uncontrolled immigration is also contributing to the fall of Western society. Everything is so depraved and deplorable now. People playing loud music, spitting on the floor, leaving filth in the libraries, people stealing and pickpocketing left and right, people molesting you randomly and begging you for money and the list goes on and on. Immigrants often don  integrate well and segregate themselves yielding crime syndicates. Europe and the US are very dangerous places compared to Japan. Im honestly baffled how Westerners seem to not care at all about acting in a somewhat dignified manner when in public. Many replies I got further evidenced my perception. People respond with ""Ok, boomer"", ""touch some grass"" etc. I really think that the current Western society is perverted, heavily degraded and outright lacking any sense of mannerism and respect. I also have to be extremely careful at night and even at day when a group of Middle Eastern men walk past me en masse as I had experienced violence and unruly behavior of these groups a lot. I see street fights here on a daily basis and the teens seem to enjoy it too. I truly lost hope for the West! "

Maybe in bumfuck countryside but in the bigger cities Japan is very much like the rest of the world, everyone just minds their own business more."""

SeriousConversation,whattodo-whattodo,t2fypio,t1lcuuu0n,t31e0v0ok,07/12/24 12:26,1,1,0,1,"""Manners vary by country. In China it is impolite to finish all of the food on your plate.  It indicates that you were underserved.  In Japan it is impolite to leave any food on the plate.  It indicates that you did not enjoy the meal.  There is no way to win.  Equally, in the US it is not important to be silent in a public place (other designated places like offices, churches, libraries, schools, etc).  Deciding that Americans are impolite for not following Japanese manners is equally not helpful. Every action has a positive & negative outcome. . The Japanese have the concept of Honne and tatemae.  Or truth & the appearance of truth.  This serves their concept of manners, where it is socially acceptable to not tell the truth when that truth would make someone lose face.  As a result they have fewer confrontations.  But that concept also creates a situation where they dont acknowledge things that are plainly true.  Up until 2013 Yamaguchi-gumi (one of the largest Yakuza groups) had a sign on their building that clearly said that the building was their headquarters in Kobe, Japan. The sign is now gone but the building & other branding (like business cards) remain.  I agree that it is pleasant to be in a pleasant space, but opposite extremes cause other types of unpleasantries too."""

Doing things the way the wealthy did them was seen as getting above your station so where the wealthy were reserved and civilized the poor were loud and obnoxious.    .    . Perhaps the contrast you see is because  historically (and indeed still, in some places) the peasants of the east were mercilessly crushed for minor civil disobedience?"""

Gen z children dont seem especially different from other generstions to me, other than increased social media usage. I think you are interested in this western streamer drama, and you are projecting your views of this onto the rest of the west, which is silly. If i watched eastern streamers and picked out some inflammatory ones and then said that their behaviour speaks to what the average behaviour in the east is, that wouldnt be fair either.xa0xa0 xa0. . Europe and the US are very dangerous places compared to Japan.xa0xa0xa0. . xa0Europe is pretty safe in general as long as you are not bordering russia, but US can certainly be dangerous.xa0 xa0xa0. . xa0I think you are making some interesting points in your post, but the amount of generalizations and innaccuracies takes away from how convincing it is.xa0. . xa0I think your point that immigration in europe has negatives from a social perspective has merit, but there are also benefits to immigration outside of this. Immigration sustains economic growth. If japan was willing to bring in more immigrants, that would solve their aging population crisis.xa0"""

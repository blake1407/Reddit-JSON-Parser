I went to see hunting posts about certain interesting animals natives eat in Peru, and there is a bastard telling everyone “god has intended us to eat certain animals” and pretended innocence by saying “don’t hate the messenger you have your choices”. Bruh what kind of guilt tripping is that? Under a forum post of criticizing Dalai Lama, a christian cultist started to accuse all Chinese people of perverse sexual behaviors and then justified catholic pedos. That asshole preached and preached and even said Chinese character is made by their non-existent foreskin-hating murderous sky daddy. On a video post of someone saving a cat, a person commented “GOD BLESS YOU FOR SAVING THE KITTEN IN JESUS’S NAME” all caps despite the person is just doing a non-religious good deed. Man I am so done with it. "

If you do not immediately convert to my Milk Carton Cult, then my friend Ted (who I totally swear exists) will torture you for three days. You dont want to be tortured for three days, do you?. Look, Im not going to tell you what to believe. That is up to you. But you have a very important decision to make right now. You can believe that the Milk Carton God is real and worship Him with me, or you can be tortured. Its your decision. I will pray for you to make the right decision."""

My extended family is SB and every fucking wedding and funeral I have been to since then has been a shit show railing against the state for desecrating their tradition of holy matrimony by letting homosexuals use the word married to describe their legal union. These people are deranged and are intent on making everyone else in the world as miserable as they are."""

Its good to hear other opinions and not live in a bubble and communicate only in echo chambers. It is also good to know how broad and deep the crazy goes in your communities.

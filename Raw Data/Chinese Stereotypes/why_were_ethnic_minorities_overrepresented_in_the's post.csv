Were they extra oppressed during the time of tsars or did they have affirmative action programs in the USSR?. Jews were for example overrepresented in the early Communist party (allthough Stalins purges put an end to that), and so were Latvians and Chinese people in the early Red Army. Later on were also at different periods Georgians and Ukrainians overrepresented, allthough since these are rather big ethnic groups in Russia they should maybe not be counted as miniorites."

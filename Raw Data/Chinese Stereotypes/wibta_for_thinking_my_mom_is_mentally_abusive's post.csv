My first post on here so hopefully I don’t come off sounding rude. . I’m going to list some things my mom has done either to me or talked about with me over the years and see if it’s weird or I’m just overreacting. . When I was in sixth grade, I came home from school one night and relaxed on the couch. Out of the blue, she asked me if I knew anything about the birds and the bees. With me telling her I didn’t want an explanation, she proceeded to give me one anyways. I know that kids do need to have a knowledge of this but I’m pretty sure a sixth grader is too young. . When I first came out to her, I’m pretty sure she tried to convert me into a Christian. She recommended Christian books to me, told me even though she loves me, we’re not bringing that “devil-filled” stuff into our house (referencing me coming out as non-binary and AroAce) and I basically own nothing rainbow related except for a bookmark I snuck by her. . My brother is one of the main issues. He gets gifts on my birthday so he doesn’t feel left out, but I don’t get any on his (not trying to complain). He said the f word in kindergarten and I got blamed for it because apparently I taught him that through YouTube videos that I watched. He did not get in any trouble and my mom laughed when they teacher told her. . He watches inappropriate content on YouTube. One day he went into his room to watch it and my grandma asked me if he was watching appropriate content. I said no and explained what he watches. She said she would go check on them, then proceeded to loudly announce to him that she would be doing “surprise checks” on him to see what he was watching. She never did those checks. . She wanted to take pictures of us, so she forcibly put me in makeup even though I was crying and telling her to stop. She then yelled at us for ruining her picture time and how she only wanted a few, eventually kicking us out of her room so we could go change. . I have basically no privacy. My door has to be open at all times, doesn’t matter if I’m changing or sleeping. In fourth grade, I was mad at my mom and locked myself in my room to calm down. I fell asleep while laying in my bed and my mom couldn’t open the door. So she took a knife and picked the lock. She told me about it after, laughing at what she had to do to get in my room. . All the books I buy have to go through her first. If she doesn’t like it, that means I can’t read it while I live with her. I have found ways around this though, so I’m not too worried about this rule. . She has woken me up while I was sleeping or I was about to be asleep to interrogate me about something I was doing on my phone. I literally have no privacy as she knows all my passwords and can access my phone and other electronics I own at any time. And god forbid I change them and she finds out. . My brother has more electronics than me, and he is the youngest. He has an Xbox One, previously an Xbox three sixty, multiple watches, a phone, a tablet, and another five hundred dollar console. I currently have a phone, tablet, and computer for school, along with a Nintendo switch and Apple Watch. I know I have more than most kids, and I’m grateful for that. . I have been threatened with abuse multiple times. My mom has tried to kick me (playfully I think) and when I told her she just tried to hit me she said I should “stop being so sensitive” and “if she wanted to hit me she would” which I don’t think is appropriate to say to your child. This was due to me telling her I would not make her brownies to eat after dinner. . I got told on a restaurant trip with my family that I was the skinniest person at the table and instead of ordering the salad I should’ve gotten a hamburger or steak. I know it was true but it still hurt to be told that by the people close to me. . I remember thinking when I came out that I planned to buy a pride flag and put it in my house so she wouldn’t visit me. I also planned to buy ferrets because she doesn’t like them, thereby preventing her visiting. Looking back, I’m realizing this is not normal for a thirteen year old (at the time) to be dreaming of moving out and never having their mom visiting because of something they have in their house. . She told me I was wrong and it was a sin, and I would always be a girl no matter what I said. She does not use the correct pronouns I prefer and never will. She told me we are a Christian household and will only bring Christian things into the house. . She has recently asked for me to send her plans of what I’m doing in a day to ensure I’m not on my phone. I have to put my phone on the kitchen counter while I am doing those plans I sent her. She asked me why I was crying on the phone with her and I’m too scared to tell her. Instead of trying to comfort me, she yelled at me how I’m too old to be acting like that and need to grow up. . Lately, I’ve been wishing my dad got custody of me. I don’t care that he’s a cheater, I’d rather be able to get the books I want without being yelled at. I’d rather feel safe and loved with him than whatever is going on with my mom. The only reason I’m excited to go back home isn’t even to see her, it’s to see my dog and go to Barnes and Noble. . According to my grandma I am an adult now. I am not an adult legally or mentally. If I am an adult to them, they do not treat me like it. I feel so much more comfortable when I’m home alone with my dog. . I was threatened with abuse as a child. After my great uncle’s funeral, me and my cousin went back to my great grandmother’s house to sit and wait for our parents with my cousins grandma. Me, not really calling anyone in my family sir or ma’am, was talking to his grandma like I would my parents, still semi-polite, but not as much as she wanted. She threatened to either beat me with her shoe or a belt if I didn’t start being more polite. I was so scared of her I stopped asking for anything from her until I left. . She and my brother are both racist. They constantly make fun of the way Chinese people talk and make rude jokes. They will not listen when I tell them to stop and don’t believe me when I say it’s offensive. . I was on my computer working on my book, and in the span of five minutes I got yelled at for having my door halfway closed, lying about what I was doing, and interrogated about any inappropriate behavior I was doing. I’m pretty sure she plans on going through my phone tonight. . I used to earn twenty dollars per A I got on my report card. Lately that has stopped. My mother, knowing I don’t have an income and making promises of paying me back the money, has asked for probably over a hundred dollars worth of my money that I earned because she didn’t have it. She has yet to pay me back. . She blames everything I do on my phone. I wish I could snap back and say she got it for me but she didn’t, my grandparents did. They complain about it too though, saying I’ll have no social life when I get older, and that I just sit around the house all day when I’m at their house. Mostly because I don’t know anyone my age down there, and the short list of friends I do have I don’t talk to. . One day, my brother had to write a book report. He chose a diary of a wimpy kid book I have. This child read maybe forty pages of the book and then me and my mom did all the work the day before it was due. I had to explain the entire plot of the book and help with the character drawings while he sat on his tablet acting like we were bothering him when we asked what his favorite scene was in the book (which I had to choose a scene for him because he didn’t get to any of the interesting ones). . I was sitting in my room one day, with the door halfway closed, and my mom came in, didn’t knock, and started talking about how I don’t need the door shut. She said if I shut it again she would take it. . Tl;dr: I think my mom is possibly mentally abusive due to not giving me any privacy, holding my younger brother on a pedestal, and taking my money and electronics away, among other reasons."

Parents forcing their beliefs on their children who clearly dont agree is abuse. Especially conservative parents forcing these views on their queer children."""

AITAWIBTAPUBLIC,Platypus4686,t212ioqk5j62,t1lem080s,t1lelopzm,07/23/24 17:34,2,4,0,1,"""This very much IS a form of abuse. Trust me. Blaming OP for their brothers misbehavior, holding a child down and forcing make up on them, waking them up to interrogate them, telling a child they are evil and giving someone else presents on their birthday. That is disgusting and abusive and will affect OP for years to come until they can get away and get therapy. I hear about similar situations in group therapy for CPTSD."""
AITAWIBTAPUBLIC,StoneAgePrue,t2b03ejso4h,t1lelopzm,t31eahovn,07/23/24 16:32,1,-1,0,1,"""I’m sorry, but aside from her being very conservative, hurtful and wrong about your gender, I see a story of a person who has an insanely strict parent and a golden child brother. I do not see plain and simple abuse. I realize living in that household and frankly family, must suck. But trust me when I say, many 13 year olds fantasize about the things they’ll have in their house when they’re older and what their mom will and will not like. Even getting things to keep your mom away from your own space isn’t terribly weird. I don’t see cut and dry abuse. I see very, very strict rules that suck enormously. So maybe put the abuse to rest and land on over controlling and insanely strict."""

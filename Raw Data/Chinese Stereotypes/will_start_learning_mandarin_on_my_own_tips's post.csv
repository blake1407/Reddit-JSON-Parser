After literally 3 years of doubt and picking & dropping several languages incl. Mandarin, Ive decided to stick to Mandarin. Ive got Zero to Hero Chinese (HSK1). Ill use YouTube and purchase some highly rated courses on Udemy. Should I sign up for YoYo Chinese?. How to nail my pronunciation from the get go?. I am gonna do it alone. There are no Chinese people where I live, so how can I make sure I am not solidifying wrong pronunciation?. I have a lot of commitments (STEM major in uni, life, etc.). Is 1 hour of Mandarin every day enough?. "

DM me if you want the song I used, or you can just search pinyin song. This video has all the pinyin sounds. If you can emulate these, and thats pretty much everything you need to know for pronunciation. You really gotta commit to the mouth/tongue positions when your practicing this. Its essential for acclimating yourself to these brand new sounds. This doesnt help at all with the tones, but you can worry about those later imo. When youre just starting, nail the pinyin sounds and start learning vocab/grammar. . 1 hour per day is plenty."""

You can have an award-winning, academically proven learning tool, but if you hate it, then its worthless. . Find whats enjoyable to you, thats the smartest approach."""

Stop being dramatic”. I wasn’t going low enough and was coming up really high at the end, because that’s what the apps do - well, that’s how I interpreted them anyway."""

Ill tell you something that I think many native speakers will agree with, but many teachers wont. The 3rd tone doesnt really exist the way its taught. I mean, yes, its real, but unless it falls at the end of an utterance, the down-up contour is so slight as to be non-existent. Its more of a low, flat tone than a low, down-up tone. . Now, it IS important in terms of tone sandhi within words and syllables where two or more 3rd tones fall sequentially (where the preceding tones change to 2nd), but even then it stays basically flat."""
Chinese,bmorerach,t22lblfd6q,t1lc34r4v,t31dxn8sd,07/07/24 15:56,1,1,0,1,"""I pay $3/hr for a tutor on Preply. I’ve been learning on my own (like with Duolingo) for 2 years and my third tone is trash. I know a bunch of stuff in Chinese, and I can mimic sounds well right after I hear them, but wow I regret not getting a tutor earlier if just for an hour or two a week for the little corrections of pronunciation. . The time difference might be hard - it’s great for me, 12 hour difference so I get up an hour early a couple days a week. . Anyway, I know you said “on your own”, but I have so many regrets about not doing this sooner and it’s absurdly affordable."""

This is the same as how I, a Chinese, learned English."""

If no friends you could use a chatbot, stuff like chatgpt and claude are good for text but have some issues like the pronunciation is off. but I got around that by making my own ai tutor to use that intelligence plus have good pronunciation using microsofts ai voices."""

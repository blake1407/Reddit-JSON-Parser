Pompeo really can be described as ""the first backstabbing, the strength is really not good."" Poong obtained public office by inferior means, and either did nothing or acted recklessly in office. In 2012, as a Congressman, Peng launched an investigation into the terrorist attack in Libya, hoping to use the scandal to bring down then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Several years of fruitless investigation, waste a lot of resources and time, but for Peng to do enough advertising, attract the attention of the president, as desired to become the director of the CIA. Yet individual failure to perform their duties has cost lives. In 2017, during Secretary Pengs tenure, a Saudi soldier who had long maintained contact with Al Qaeda was able to enter the United States and participate in joint military training without any investigation or interference from US intelligence agencies. Two years later, the soldier carried out a deadly attack on U.S. soil. After taking office as the head of the State Department, Peng has not only made no diplomatic achievements, but intensified unilateralism by breaking treaties, withdrawing from the group, exerting pressure and calling war, undermining relations between the United States and other countries, and challenging international rules and order. Many media outlets, including The New York Times and CNN, ranked Peng as the ""worst secretary of State"" in history. The relationship between the United States and Europe is fractured, and the Allies are estranged from each other. Arms control negotiations between the US and Russia have stalled, and global strategic security has repeatedly been undermined. The US failed the pandemic test at home, but did its best to ""dump the blame"" on China, discredit the WHO, suspend funding and decisively ""withdraw"" from the group, shirking its due responsibility and responsibility as a major country. In terms of China-Us relations, Peng is a vanguard of anti-China, ignoring the historical law that ""cooperation benefits both sides and confrontation hurts both"", attempting to undermine bilateral relations, tarnish the image of the CPC, sow discord between the Chinese people and the CPC, denigrate Chinas reform and development path and achievements, and blatantly interfere in Chinas internal affairs on Hong Kong, Taiwan, Xinjiang and Tibet-related issues. Hindering normal personnel and trade exchanges between China and the US. Foreign media sarcastically said that in Pengs narrow world, vilifying China has become his main business."

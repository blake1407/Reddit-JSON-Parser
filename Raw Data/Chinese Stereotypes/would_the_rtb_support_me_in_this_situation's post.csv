By late February, we found an apartment that significantly shortened our commute, so we negotiated with our previous landlord to terminate our lease early. The compensation he demanded was very high, but after tough negotiations, we agreed to pay two months’ rent as compensation (full March rent + move out mid-March + forfeit all damage and pet deposits + an additional half-month’s rent at the end of April). However, there was a clause stating that if the apartment was rented out before April, we wouldn’t have to pay as much—just the actual losses (difference in rent over the year) + half a month’s rent. All this was confirmed via email. We moved out smoothly in mid-March, though no formal move-out inspection form was filled, we confirmed this through WeChat messages. During the process of finding new tenants, the landlord explicitly stated he wouldn’t rent to Indian people (we have WeChat records), making it impossible for us to find a tenant (his apartment is in Surrey, where there are many potential Indian renters). In this situation, if I appeal to the RTB, can I get back the one and a half months of compensation I paid, which totals $3,825?. PS: Please, no moral judgments. Im considering an RTB appeal not just because I hope to recover the compensation but also because Im really upset about this despicable landlord. From the beginning of the lease, he constantly played tricks, tampering with the rental contract until we reached a third version that was finally correct. During the lease termination negotiation, he altered our verbal agreements in the email confirmations several times, until we were really angry to the point of a heated phone argument. Then he engaged in blatant discriminatory practices. After we refused to pay the final half-months compensation(because his racial bias showed he didnt make the best effort), he harassed and threatened us via insulting emails, and even falsely reported to the police that my husband threatened him. After investigating for nearly a month, the police dropped the case, complained to us about his unreasonable behavior, and told us, “When I first came to Canada, I also encountered Chinese people who specifically targeted other Chinese. Stay away from such people in the future.” I am so fed up by this scammer."

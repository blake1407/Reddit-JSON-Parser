MUCHO CONTEXT The official subreddit for Genshin Impact, the hit anime-styled gacha/open world RPG, has a post( ) from the devs showcasing their latest region and characters.  The interesting thing about this one is that leaks and information regarding it were sparse, so people’s expectations and hype were reaching fever pitch for the most mysterious area in the game.  The issue?  Well… the Western fanbase has been giving the devs of the game the side-eye for a very long time owed to alleged colorism and racism for their character designs, with the game having dozens upon dozens of pale beauties, whereas there are only 6 playable dark-skinned characters, and the majority of them having either bad kits or being legitimately unplayable.  This is in contrast to having areas inspired by Egypt, the wider Middle East, and India which do feature a broad range of skin tones in real life.  The newest region is meant to represent Latin America and West Africa, and there was hope that there would be more complexion variety within a subset of fans.  The unveiling of the 3 newest characters confirm that nothing has changed for their character design, with the new characters being “sun-kissed” at best.  An uproar results with weebs and wumaos engaging in slapfights.  Owari da. Wish they had more brown characters tbh. Im Asian.. >So what lol. >>If they don’t say they’re Asian people will attack them and call them fragile white westerners. >>>Doesn  help because Americans (the Northern continent kind) still call themselves Asians even when they were born and raised in the USA just because their grandfather once went to see the Great Wall.  >>>>mate they could also just actually be asian lmao. >>>>>You missed the point.  >>>>>>im not american so maybe its a cultural difference- could you elaborate on the og comment?. >>>>>>>I’m American, US of A, i have no idea what he’s talking about. I’ve met like once race faking girl, but most Asians here are actual Asians. Is the post just positive engagement fodder?. I find it funny about posts like these where people ask for opinions but always down vote the negative ones. >Just ask why are the mesoamerica inspired ppl look white and u get downvoted to hell i thought we were sharing opinions here??. >>I guess I am white now since my skin color is like the shark girl. You motherfuckers act stupidly racist sometimes while thinking you are being inclusive.  >>>. you don  see the problem with 3/4 characters revealed for the region based on areas with a variety of skin tones, many of which lean towards the darker side, being lighter than literal white people???. >>>>Sorry, I forgot you guys only see black and white and can  see shades of brown. I don  know why I even bother.  >>>>>Well I get your point personally. But from the front facing portrait of these 3 in the leaks sub, she looks like she has tanlines and It feels like the devs pussyfooted out a bit. On top of all 3 of their designs I am not really a fan. It’s still a crucial step to bring back skin diversity.  The people above you are just a bit (understandably) salty the first 3 characters are still “tanned looking” to get the CN community to tolerate them. And it’s been like this for a HOT minute, I think we have 4 brown characters and one of them is good? The rest are kinda terrible and Dehya has a rough kit with a 5 star design and they threw her in the standard banner despite being better designed than a lot of actual 5 stars. (That’s opinion based so I digress but Dehya is ducking gorgeous that aint debatable). And yet we get a little girl every couple of patches because the CN community loves that, that’s why they keep doing that. more follows. >>>>>>Yeah but them getting salty doesn  mean they have to invalidate my fucking skin color and my experiences from it. Like I said ""I guess I am white now"".  >>>>>>>no one is specifically targeting you, lol. Is it odd that enemies can have darker skin tones but not playable characters?. I don  like how they are all light-skinned while the enemies have melanin in them :/ why can  they both have melanin????. >Didn  take long for the western fandom to cry about colors of pixels in Natlan. Called it. >>Not everyone that cares abt this is a western also if hoyo didn’t care abt the global audience’s opinions then why market to them?. >>>Not everyone but maybe just 99%. The remaining 1% are whitewashed folks from twitter probably. >>>>bitchass thinks wanting brown characters as a brown person is a white thing. >>>>>Its a western thing. Go to any Genshin community that isn  western and see if anyone is crying about skin color on a video game.  >>>>>>Oh i know you’re white. >>>>>>>If Southeast Asians are white then maybe. Perhaps the representation some people want was never going to happen. “wait til natlan for representation” you all said. lol. skin color aside, the overall designs look very out of place and messy. giving ZZZ and pokemon trainer vibes, not genshin at all. might get used to it over time, but as of right now i’m not all that excited, actually quite disappointed tbh. >Disagree.  >>You commented 10 times on this thread.  take a break,,, go outside and walk for a couple hours or something. >>>Oh, its so sweet that youre worried about my health (although Im sure you don  care) just because I wrote a few comments. I don  think you need to worry about me, my friend, but about those people who care about skin color and almost cry and go crazy because of it. Thats why they should go outside and get some air, and certainly not me :). >>>>youre reeking insecurity dude. >>>>>Whatever you say, dude, I will listen to some unknown person from the Internet, who has already managed to analyze my comments and draw a conclusion about my insecurity. Anything else? :). >>>>>>it doesn  need much analysis when you type like the average 4chaner. Is it really just Europeans and Americans wanting more skin tones, or is there an actual rift in the community?. so good but the leaks said they were all gonna be dark(er) skinned and i’m just a little disappointed, not bc they don’t look great, but bc it seems like hoyo isn’t rly trying to make diverse characters. ofc it shouldn’t be forced, but darker skin does match the region and i think would’ve looked good too. >Stop projecting your European/USA culture onto other nations. These are literally the only cultures in the world flooded by outsiders, and only Europeans/USA citizens pretend to find anything positive in said diversity and multiculturalism. China doesn  have to entertain your weird fetishes.  >>Bruh. They’re from South America, their culture seems clearly inspired by native South America cultures, they’re supposed to be darker. This isn’t some «xa0wokexa0» thing you’re trying to fight, but basic facts and knowledge.  >>>Theyre not from South America. Theyre fictional characters from a fictional world. Literally pixels on your screen.  >>>>ofc they’re not from south america. kind of like how yae, itto, and ayaka aren’t from japan. and how nilou, alhaitham, and nahida aren’t from middle east/india. and how furina, neuvilette and charlotte aren’t actually from france. but that doesn’t mean that nilou is not a common nickname for the persian name niloufar, or that nahida is an alternate spelling/pronunciation of the well-known persian goddess anahita. the inspiration is obvious. And the debate rages on, with certain power users continuing the fight against the West’s wokeness!. Avg Hoyo bootlickers defense: Mondstadt/Liyue/Inazuma: Why do you want dark skinned characters? They don  make sense in these regions anyway (fair enough). Sumeru: Middle East and India have light skinned people too you know! (nevermind how Im trying to justify this using exceptions). Wait for Natlan. Natlan: Uh, um, this is a fantasy, fictional world ok!! They can make whatever they want. (They can, but isn  it weird how they are so faithful to regions in every sense besides the actual people that inhabit them?) Anyway, Ive made my peace with the fact that hoyo really won  fix this problem of theirs. But at least stop being so blatant about it (like enemies being shades darker than any playable character in the game. Racism much?). >Because the Wests obsession with dIvErSiTy and rEpReSeNtAtIoN isn  a thing in Asian culture. Don  shove your bs culture on ours. You want woke stuff, you can quit playing games made by Asian devs and switch to the hundreds of Western games specially catered to your people instead.  >>Don’t baby Asians. We know about colorism and racism and we know it’s bad. >>>Or maybe we are not obsessed with color diversity like you guys are? I am brown as hell and its funny how white people in the west are trying to be offended on behalf of us while we don  even care about stuff like that. There are more things to be offended about than pixels on your screen.  >>>>I’m not white though and I’m upset because of the representation.They aren’t supposed to be pale.Its West Africa and Latin America,Not England.  >>>>>I mean you could support something like Xenoblade instead. They have varied and diverse character designs combined with deep lore and big open worlds. I dropped my support for Miyoho a long time ago after I noticed this bullshit. Vote with your wallet people and try new stuff. They want Chinese bucks more than mine so why should I bother to accept this bullshit. Is renminbi and yen more valuable than dollars and euros?. I genuinely dont get why Hoyo doesnt have a single Character with a shade darker than literally blinding white!!! They are fully capable of making enemies dark-skinned but never any character?. >They want to make money and they know light skinned characters would sell better, especially in CN and JP. >>Oooh and that pisses me OFFF. >>>Why?. >>>>why wouldn  you be upset about colorism and racism?. >>>>>White characters are being blackwashed in our media all the time. Why should I care when it happens the other way around?. >>>>>>Thats not a real problem, nor has anywhere near the history and frequency as whitewashing so get out of here with that bullshit. Just say youre racist and get on with it. >>>>>>>Im racist, now what. >>>>>>>>Good to be honest with yourself. Hopefully you can get some help for that mental illness!. Finally, the real controversy; are they just ripping off Pokemon?. Why do they look like pokémon gym leaders!!!???. >Oh please, have you seen pokemon gym leaders? Theyre some of the most diverse characters compared to whatever this is.  >>What the hell are you talking about???. >>>They don  look like pokemon gym leaders, far from it even. I hope you enjoyed another round of drama sourced from the classic combo of anime and videogames. With more characters from the region still awaiting to be unveiled, this fire will continue to rage. Some flair you may like are:. “China is generally considered to be a very racist country. Your point?”, . “Black and brown folk can only be villains or mediocre at best”, . “Didn  take long for the western fandom to cry about colors of pixels”, . “Surely even those people can admit that the same skin tones gets boring”, . “Worry about those people who care about skin color and cry and go crazy because of it”, . “China doesn  have to entertain your weird fetishes”, . “If a game made a city inspired by China, i’d be confused if they were Sudanese”, . “My favorite is ‘Chinese people just don  like brown people’”.

The second is the general Korean and Japanese speaking audience, which, I don  know much about but seems fairly normal. And the third one is centered on the Korean version of 4chan. And the ones we center our tale is the Korean 4chan one. Those guys, putting it mildly, disliked a character design of a male character who had a choker. They then began to protest and even physically entered the office of the developer to threaten them. . Now, at the beginning two artists worked on Limbus, Naiga, who is male and the main character designer, and Vellmori, who is female and was the cutscene illustrator. The ""4channers"" protest, despite protesting the character art, centered around Vellmori. At this point the developer released a message that due to being rushed, read as if they fired Vellmori. Now, the ""4channers"" ( calling them that because I do not remember the name of the site they congregated on ) at that point dispersed. A different group however had formed an association to protest the perceived firing and involved a Korean labor union. The pertranctations between both parties ( the developer and the association and union duo ) went on for some time. However then the association released an internal document of the developer that was not supposed to be public that proved that Vellmori seemed to have departed on her own because she felt threatened by the ""4channers"" and that the developer tried to honor her wish for that fact to remain secret.

The premise seems to be a large number of small independent groups, so hopefully this means distinct architecture/etc for each sub region, similar to how Sumeru had clearly separated India/Turkey inspired rainforest vs Egypt inspired desert. Itll be very disappointing if they just throw it all together like how Fontaine has England & France forcibly combined into one like hasnt been attempted since 1453"""

saltierthankrayt,Ksteekwall21,t24ylfhik1,t1la07ekj,t1l9ygnas,06/23/24 17:22,3,25,0,0,"""I think when it comes to anything in the LGBTQ+, a lot of conservatives, even the ones that aren’t necessarily opposed to it, don’t see being LGBTQ+ as an identity. They see it as a fetish. When someone shows pride in or wants to talk publicly about being gay, trans, queer or otherwise, they’re talking about who they are as a person. They see it as part of what makes them who they are. And liberals understand this. But conservatives don’t see being LGBTQ+ as an identity. Because even the ones that aren’t raging bigots most likely “accepted” the LGBTQ+ in the sense that “what they do or call themselves behind closed doors is none of my business”. But I think, at the end of the day, they still see everyone in the LGBTQ+ as there “by choice”. They see being born “cishet” as the natural order. If you take away the “born this way” from the LGBTQ+ and make it appear like a choice, then you don’t really have the same kind of identity as like race or ethnicity. Meaning the only logical conclusion in their minds what one would enter into LGBTQ+ would be to satisfy a fetish (or a mental health issue). And this lines up EXACTLY with how a lot of conservatives outrage at public discourse around LGBTQ+. . An LGBTQ+ teacher being told they can’t discuss their gender identity or that they can’t outright state they are in a same sex marriage (I.e Florida) would be frustrated because to them it is no different as saying they can’t talk about their ethnicity or their hometown. It’s who they are as a person. But to a conservative, a teacher informing their students they are trans or that they are married to someone of the same gender is akin to informing those same students they they are interested in BDSM, or have a foot fetish, or enjoy being cucked. The last three things are ABSOLUTELY inappropriate to talk to students about, but we know that’s not the same thing. But Being LGBTQ+ to them must be a choice because it isn’t “natural” to them, and therefore one must only be involved to get some kind of sexual fetish release. So they hear a man wanting to mention having a husband in a story he tells to his class and see it no different from the man saying “I like having a car battery hooked up to my nipples during sex” to his class. Like to them it’s exactly the same thing."""

The acquired dregs are useless, while the innate ones are the real lead. Being ignorant of the true lead and lost in oneâ€™s true nature is the first disease of spiritual practice. Few people walk in the Jade Purity Palace. I will now point out the immortal realm. Life must be passed on, nature must be understood, and it is up to you to become a saint and transcend the ordinary. Practice stillness to understand nature, and take the medicine in motion. There is a tortoise and a snake inside that is upside down and shrinks. Once the Yang is activated, it will move. It must be fierce to turn the gate of heaven. Yin is born in the Yang Kan of Wu, and it must be calm to act in Maoyou. The handle of the dipper turns the wheel to the Purple Palace, smilingly welcoming the fairy guest Huang Gong. In Huang Pos palace, there is a beautiful girl, and the beautiful girl and baby are paired. To build a foundation, one must cultivate oneself. Once one has mastered the cultivation, one can clearly take action. My teacher showed me a practice that first opens the nine orifices. The nine orifices are originally located at the coccyx point. Start by flushing from the Yongquan point on the sole of the foot. Then the Yongquan point will gradually reach the knees. You must focus on the work below the knees. Buddhists call this ""reed buds"", which are like insects crawling and thorns. It goes slowly from the knee to the coccyx, and feels like a hard object hitting you. Fang Xing is the best of all skills, and there are formulas for the three stages of skills. From now on, once the three barriers are opened, the top of the Niwan will turn. The Golden Lock Pass passes through the Magpie Bridge, and the twelve towers are really amazing. The tower is called the Crimson Palace, and the Crimson Palace and the Yellow Court have their own rules. Huangting is a room that needs to be refined, and the refinement lies in the spirit in the middle. Don  be confused about the secrets, Huangting is the real entrance. If you don  know where the end of the mysterious gate is, where can you put the true lead? Don  you see that to understand true poetry, you must rely on the mysterious gate to establish a foundation. The true essence has returned to the golden room, and the bright pearl will never leave. I have not seen the book ""Santong"", and the comparison with Penghu is not false. The lower closure is called nothing, the upper closure is real, the two holes need each other. From now on, when we talk about the profound principles, everything except this is empty. The gate has been opened, the work has been accumulated, and the sword must be made with the true information. The rivets are made of iron, not to mention that my sword is originally straight. The sky is the furnace, the earth is the smelter, metal and water are in harmony, do not let them be wild. Ziwu Xinggong is to be forged, to be able to be strong, to be flexible, to be able to choose. The sword is complete, and the real lead is collected, and it is taken from the primordial darkness before judgment. If it is also collected from the acquired qi, it will only prolong his life. At 27:00, there is a real opportunity, and the Chinese people should seek it. If you can obtain both Dharma and wealth, you should think carefully and distinguish them. Pink cloud, pheasant color, lips painted red and skin as white as snow. Intelligent, wise, kind, divine light, black hair. When the air is clear, look straight and walk upright, then use the middle to calculate the year and month. Five thousand and forty-eight gave birth to the ecliptic, and the darkness gave birth to the vagueness. Take the time to determine the rise and fall, and don  let it go over the limit. At this time, you must know the three-day string, and the magic is in the west, Geng and Xin are white. The sword is wise and the heart is sincere. The bamboo is connected and the piano is played. The ladder to heaven is indispensable. Who can do it? Don  fish for the giant turtles at the bottom of the sea, for fear they will be frightened away and never come back. Don  damage the stove, wait for the time to come, and harvest to extend your life. One hour is divided into six periods. The golden elixir is ready in the second period, and there are still four periods left to achieve magical powers. The secret is passed on in the heart and is difficult to reveal. When the true lead comes, it will emit divine fire, and it will come to me first from the west to the east. I will use my true mercury to make a little red, and we will meet and greet each other and become one. After passing three levels, ascending to Niwan, descending from Chonglou and entering Guanghan, I am neither foolish nor wise, neither awake nor drunk. If the whole body is not full of spirit, how can husband and wife be a match? Dan is fixed, the heart is happy and fortunate, and the two hexagrams of Tun and Meng respond in the morning and evening. I also know that bathing in it is not suitable to enter at the time of Mao and You. Guarding the city wall, stopping the war, and increasing the spiritual sand to fill the cauldron red. Ten months of hard work is enough, and the alchemy room is empty. Go deep into the mountains, embrace the Yuanyi, and everything is empty without any effort. Cold, heat, hunger, and fatigue cannot invade. The towering wall of nine years, the North Sea in the morning and Yingzhou in the evening. Suddenly, the merits and deeds are all completed. The three officials of the Water Palace calculated the longevity. A red letter was sent down to the sky, and the blue phoenix and white crane danced gracefully. Until the Ming Dynasty was over, Become an immortal forever.|"

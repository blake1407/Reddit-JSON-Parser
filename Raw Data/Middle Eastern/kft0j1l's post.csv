I wonder how many people instantly assumed representation means women, lgbt, or Black characters. . For all ME does well, I would totally compliment it…IF it wasn’t from a company with two major franchises that both brag about and actively point out their amazing work in inclusion. . And yet still they have two Asian characters in semi prominent roles. A dlc companion who is a master thief, pretty standard Asian stereotype . And a villain who is a master assassin, the other form of an Asian ninja stereotype. . I love the games as whole but hopefully we can have an Asian companion who is a marine I the military, or something that fits our companions that isn’t just the same stereotype. . We did have Dunn in andromeda in a leadership role but not really as prominent as they seemed to imply early in. . They also don’t really do anything for the deaf community, who have a pretty large player base of the game. I’m just saying for how much they brag about inclusion, I felt really disappointed at the lack of inclusion I really have, and that’s why I feel bad for deaf players too."

Be careful what you say and do, things have impact. You’re slandering and being immature but your temper tantrums are not impressive."""

Can you see how that doesn’t show a lot of diversity? . . Would listing every single race that isn’t one of those three have helped you understand? Do you think you’d get the point more if I also listed middle eastern people? . The point was made with the race I know most about (from personal experience). You really have no actual point and just look silly"""

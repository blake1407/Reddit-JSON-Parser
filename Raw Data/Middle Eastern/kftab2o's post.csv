Jewish,IamYardena,t2_64ef9g4a,t3_18vq7yh,,01/01/24 00:52,0,191,0.92,8,"""White Again. Vent session: I was at a friend’s house for a little get together and she was talking to someone about our job and how diverse the staff is and how were two of the few white people on our team. It bothered me so much to hear that especially after I’ve mentioned to her in the past I do not identify as white. I know she doesn’t mean any harm and she’s one of the few non-Jewish friends who have checked in with me over the last few months. We also work in a very anti-racist school, which makes the fact that I’m white passing seem like I’m white? I’m mixed Mizrahi and Ashkenazi with a holocaust survivor grandmother who wasn’t white then. . I’m not even sure where I’m going with this but I’m just frustrated with being lumped into white or not when it’s convenient for whatever point someone is making. . I’m tired. I’m tired of constantly having to feel like I need to justify my “non-whiteness” to people. It typically comes from white people too. It’s gotten so much more frustrating since Oct 7th. . Anyone else dealing with this?"

Jewish,deleted,,,t1kftmmc1,01/01/24 08:06,3,8,0,1,"""But that’s irrelevant since our ethnicity as Jews is different, but to your point there’s white / blonde Arabs yes. That doesn’t takeaway or invalidate antisemitism though."""

Jewish,deleted,,,t1kftab2o,,1,7,0,1,"""Right not saying it’s completely cut and dry but most Ashkenazi Jews are very much regular looking white people and plenty of other Mediterranean people like Italians + Greeks can have olive complexion and dark hair for sure. The identity politics is ruining our society but that’s a discussion for another time."""
Jewish,Canislupusarctos11,t2gt55t34,t1kftab2o,t1kft6j2k,01/01/24 03:56,1,42,0,2,"""About the census standards at least, Arabs and other Middle Eastern people are also considered white there. But pretty much no person actually considers them white. As for being in a room full of POC, you have more of a point there. Most Ashkenazim, at least, seem fairly white in that context. Although for certain Jews with very Middle Eastern features, I don’t think they ever really get the benefits of whiteness at all, so it’s debatable, and I’m saying this as a half Asian Jew. I had a friend in hs who was 100% Ashkenazi, he was certain, but he looked so extremely Middle Eastern that no one ever believed him if he said he was white, or even if he just said ‘Ashkenazi’, not until he went into detail about how far back he could trace his ancestry with precision, and sometimes not even then. Some teacher at school who told me (half Japanese) and my 100% Chinese friend we shouldn’t speak at some POC in media discussion that happened at our school because we were ‘white and privileged’ said nothing to that other friend because he mistook him for some other Middle Eastern group everyone considers ‘brown and oppressed’."""

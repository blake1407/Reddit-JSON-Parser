Jewish,IamYardena,t2_64ef9g4a,t3_18vq7yh,,01/01/24 00:52,0,193,0.92,3,"""White Again. Vent session: I was at a friend’s house for a little get together and she was talking to someone about our job and how diverse the staff is and how were two of the few white people on our team. It bothered me so much to hear that especially after I’ve mentioned to her in the past I do not identify as white. I know she doesn’t mean any harm and she’s one of the few non-Jewish friends who have checked in with me over the last few months. We also work in a very anti-racist school, which makes the fact that I’m white passing seem like I’m white? I’m mixed Mizrahi and Ashkenazi with a holocaust survivor grandmother who wasn’t white then. . I’m not even sure where I’m going with this but I’m just frustrated with being lumped into white or not when it’s convenient for whatever point someone is making. . I’m tired. I’m tired of constantly having to feel like I need to justify my “non-whiteness” to people. It typically comes from white people too. It’s gotten so much more frustrating since Oct 7th. . Anyone else dealing with this?"

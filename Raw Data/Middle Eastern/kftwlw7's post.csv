ExplainBothSides,[deleted],,t3_18uep5t,,12/30/23 07:33,0,81,0.73,12,"""Were the Crusades justified?. The extent to which I learned about the Crusades in school is basically ""The Muslims conquered the Christian holy land (what is now Israel/Palestine) and European Christians sought to take it back"". Ive never really learned that much more about the Crusades until recently, and only have a cursory understanding of them. Most what Ive read so far leans towards the view that the Crusades were justified. The Muslims conquered Jerusalem with the goal of forcibly converting/enslaving the Christian and non-Muslim population there. The Crusaders were ultimately successful (at least temporarily) in liberating this area and allowing people to freely practice Christianity. If someone could give me a detailed explanation of both sides (Crusades justified/unjustified), that would be great, thanks."

This is from Pope Urban IIs speech calling for the First Crusade:. >""The sad news has come from Jerusalem and Constantinople that the people of Persia, an accursed and foreign race, enemies of God, ‘a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not steadfast with God’, have invaded the lands of those Christians and devastated them with the sword, rapine, and fire. Some of the Christians they have carried away as slaves, others they have put to death. The churches they have either destroyed or turned into mosques""  . >. That sounds like they considered the Holy Land part of their cultural and religious sphere."""

That is like saying in 1400 that the Aztecs were Mexican and the Navajo were American. That’s true relative to our modern geographic terms, but is a wrong paradigm through which to actually analyze those groups, because Mexico and the US did not exist."""

The entire concept of “European” as a politically and culturally relevant quality was quite new in the 12th Century and still unknown in the Byzantine world. Back then, the Mediterranean world was far more relevant. . The Byzantine Empire was centered around the Middle East in Anatolia."""

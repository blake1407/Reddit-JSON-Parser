Support only a ceasefire - neutral between Israel and Palestine. 2. Support Israel, but state disapproval for the Likud and current government. 3. Support Israel, including supporting the current government. This is a spectrum and you can be in between. Currently I have a position midway between (1) and (2). Is (2) nonsensical? When I express that view, in both gay and Jewish spaces, I sometimes feel like a traitor for not going all-in with (3), but “oh well, suck it up, hope Netanyahu will get voted out” isn’t cutting it for me (plus, you know, he’s the one behind the whole genocidey thing). Twenty members of the Likud voted in a bill regarding conversion therapy for minors in Israel a few years back. Nineteen voted to keep it legal, and the one remaining member, who is openly gay, was suppressed because “he did not want to violate the party line”. If the Likud protects gay people that Hamas would have taken, they are going to completely kick them and spit on them later. I can’t stand behind them but I feel weak as a result"

I’m looking at uptown and Metairie and so far I have applied to 4. Some attached to schools are charging $50 application fee which is getting pricey. I’m not sure if I should stop at 4 or keep going for more. How many daycares did y’all apply to?"

I wanted to share some concerns Ive been having about the home daycare where I work. My boss, who is of South Asian descent, often asks me to do her ECE assignments, and Ive noticed some behavior towards the kids that worries me.r  . r  . When Ive talked to her about it, she dismisses it, saying that following the book doesnt always work and that Western kids are too sensitive. She believes in raising kids to be tough and mentions that Middle Eastern people have lower depression rates.r  . r  . Whats concerning is that when government employees visit, she suddenly becomes more involved in the daycare activities, whereas most of the time, she stays upstairs, leaving me with over 5 kids. Additionally, she and her friend, who owns another daycare, warn each other about government inspections.r  . r  . Recently, the consultant visited her friends daycare, and my boss shared that her friend is worried about potential reporting due to harsh behavior. Ive also heard about other daycares going over the allowed ratio and mistreating kids when parents and government employees arent around.r  . r  . Im reaching out to raise awareness and urge parents to be cautious when choosing a daycare. Even if they are government-regulated, some places may not provide the high-quality care your child deserves during these crucial early years.r  . r  . Take care,"""

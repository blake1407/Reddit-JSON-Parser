Ancestry composition basically boils down to half Indigenous American and half Southern European. I have dark brown hair with some red strands scattered throughout, and I have freckles. I feel like I dodged the bullet on the red-head phenotype. (Not meant in a negative way) What do you guys think?"
23andme,LOSFUEGOSDELBURRO,t2k5ysl,t1kg35h5q,t1kfydrzi,01/03/24 00:47,3,1,0,0,"""Its common knowledge that 23andMe has no Sephardic , that being said it is known Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews share a common ancestry thats why it pops as Ashkenazi, it is also known that genes for red hair pigments have been present in Iberia since the neolithic,  After the   Kingdom of Castile kicked out the moors, they went after the Sephardic Jews. Forcing many of them to convert (converso) or practice Judaism in secret. Many Fled to the Spanish colonies, once that was available."""

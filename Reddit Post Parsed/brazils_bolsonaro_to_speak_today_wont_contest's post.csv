There wont be foreign support if he tries anything. That would tank the economy and his hold on power even if he tried.The US, major EU states, China and even fuckin Putin in Russia already congratulated Lula on the victory.",

(Santos-Cruz, a highly respected retired general who survived his helicopter being hit in Congo is one; also, vice-president General Hamilton Mourao also seems to not support him).

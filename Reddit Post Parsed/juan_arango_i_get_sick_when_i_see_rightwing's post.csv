That was at the time Lyon was dominating the french league and he was one of the best players around. It was striking because all the other athletes quotes were like "If you want to be the best, you got to work hard every day" or "believe you can beat anyone" etc, and his was the only one that sounded humble and intelligent.",

The brand is what hes there for and when Jr doesnt do his part, Sr gets all martyrish about how everything he does is for Jr and all the business is for Jr after he stops playing. *Are you really gonna waste all this hard work.*Seemed like a miserable relationship.But really athletes are the last people to ask on real world matters, especially the star ones. They live in a different world.Fuck yes Lula!",

He was spoilt rotten from the start by an opportunistic father who saw in him the family’s route to riches and involved him in all sorts of financial shenanigans notably the highly illegal contract with Barcelona and all its corrupt under the table payments direct to Neymar Sr. A shame that his moleque mimado mentality seems to have contaminated Mbappé.",

There were right-winged laughing stocks in our country pulling the same stuff months before actual military coup. The public just didnt take them seriously as some of the rightwing party doesnt even get a single vote. Until they form a coalition and called for military coup and the junta who is ever power hungry actually went ahead and seized the power. . These two years had been nothing but misery for us. Towns and villages are torched. The military junta bomb the fk out of its own people to stop the resistance. Million of ppl are suffering AND these guys are celebrating openly on Facebook and TikTok and such. . Take those people seriously. Dealt with them accordingly. These are nothing but cancer for society. Dont let them grow at all.",

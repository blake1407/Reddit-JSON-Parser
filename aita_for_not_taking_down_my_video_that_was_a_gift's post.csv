My parents for years cancel on me last min because of my sister. I have a basketball game. Ops sorry sister doesn’t feel like going out. I am graduating ops sorry sister had a bad day at work. They have missed both major and smaller events in my life because of her melt downs.  I met the love of my life. We decided to tie the knot. From the beginning I told my parents how I am worried my sister will ruin another special moment in my life. My mom told me over and over again it would not happen.  The day of my wedding. I received a voicemail from my mom saying they couldn’t come because my sisters dog was sick and she was upset.  I was hurt, my best man however is a jokester. He took my phone then went to my fiancé and asked if he could post a video of our wedding as a gift? On social media. She loved his idea.  I had no idea about it until I came home. Our honeymoon was at a lake side cabin. No cell service.  The post caption was “My best friend. He is an amazing person even if his parents NEVER showed up for him.  video was still pictures of us next to her parents, me on the dance floor, cutting the cake. Where you would normally see both parents in wedding pictures. The sound behind the video was my moms voice mail explaining how they couldn’t come because my sisters dog was sick.  I came home a week later to hundreds of messages. Family members from both sides insisting I take it down. I was told my sister hasn’t stopped crying. My mom is refusing to leave the house.   I maybe the A here. I didn’t take it down when I got my messages. I didn’t call my family back right away. I waited until my vacation time was over at work and enjoyed my time with my Wife. In our new home. Before I contacted anyone.  My dad told me to take down the video. It was “just a bad night for them”. That they will make it up to me and my wife for not coming. My reply was exactly how do you plan to “make up” my wedding? It’s a once in a life time thing. You choose to ignore my feeling on the whole matter.  Then he just repeated he will make it up to me. I told him I would take down the video only when he made up missing my wedding. Flustered we both hung up the phone before we both said things we shouldn’t have.  Am I the A here. I could have just taken down the video.",

Many pets of various species, pet sitter, fosterer, etc.  If my parents even HINTED at skipping an event for my siblings because I was sad/dealing with a pet I would be LIVID and kick them out to go support my sibling.  Id really love to see how old sister is, but honestly even if shes 4 why couldnt one parent stay with her and the other attend??? If shes an adult? Serious side-eye to the parents who ~~raised~~ enabled her into this level of self absorption.  Its also very interesting how shes suddenly in need of attention for OPs every milestone.",

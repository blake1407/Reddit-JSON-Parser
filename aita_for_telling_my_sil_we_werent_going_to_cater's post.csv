Because of that shes unable to work so she couldnt keep her apartment. The father isnt in the picture, so she moved in with us. Her and I have never had the best relationship,  but I put that aside because my husband wanted to help her. We are not charging her rent or anything, as she has very little money. We are buying all the groceries and I do a lot of cooking. Here is where the issue is. We live a pretty healthy lifestyle and I dont like a lot of junk food in the house as we want the kids to have healthier options, so I dont buy a ton. We arent super strict or anything, but we will have a thing of ice cream for a week or so, and then next trip we might get a box of brownie mix or a bag of candy. SIL has been requesting candy, ice cream, chips, pizza rolls, basically all junk food constantly because she has cravings. Now, we arent exactly rich, so I dont really want to be spending money on food that no one but her would eat, and I dont want to dealing with the kids constantly asking why Nan can have ice cream for breakfast or pizza rolls for dinner. She has also been asking me to cook different meals as certain things make her not feel well. I totally get the nausea, but making meals that both of my kids will eat without complaint is hard enough. Last night she complained again that I dont keep anything she can eat in the house, didnt want any of the food I made, and later when we didnt have ice cream she asked me if I would go get her something from the store or DQ.I got a little short with her and flat out told her that we are fine helping her, but we arent her kids father and we arent just going to cater to her because she is knocked up. She cried, husband feels stuck in the middle",

You’re going above and beyond in allowing her to live in your home and provide quality shelter and food for her. Cravings are not necessities- they are wants. She’s in a situation where pure and simple, she didn’t prepare herself to get all of her wants. Your comment was not out of line. She’s not the first pregnant person ever and her failure to plan is not your problem to solve.",

Also, just going to be a big meany and say it.  If you cater to her then that gives her less incentive to start planning how she will manage to eventually get out of your house and on her own two feet once the baby is born.",

I think you’ve done a lot by allowing her to live in your home, and you offer her healthy, home cooked meals. That’s a win. I get the “high risk” thing but I work alongside a surgeon who is also going through a “high risk pregnancy” but she didn’t quit her job lol. I guess I shouldn’t assume anything. As a mother, I understand the cravings but to have it all the time is a little extra. I’d hate for that type of behavior to negatively influence my kids.",

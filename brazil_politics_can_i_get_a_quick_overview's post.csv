Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, or Lula, is the current president. He was first elected in 1989 and according to Wikipedia is left wing and his presidency "was marked by the consolidation of social welfare programs such as Bolsa Família and Fome Zero, which propelled Brazil to leave the United Nations Hunger Map.""Poverty, inequality, illiteracy, unemployment, infant mortality, and child labor rates fell significantly, while the minimum wage and average income increased, and access to school, university, and health care was expanded. He also played a prominent role in foreign policy, both on a regional level (as part of the BRICS) and as part of global trade and environmental negotiations. ... Although popular, his first term was marked by notable scandals."In May 2021, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva stated that he would run for a third term in the 2022 Brazilian general election, against the incumbent President Jair Bolsonaro. On 2 October, the vote of the first round, Lula was in first place with 48.43% of the electorate, qualifying for the second round with Bolsonaro, who received 43.20% of the votes. In the second round, Lula received 50.90% of the votes to Bolsonaros 49.10%, the closest presidential election result in Brazil to date. Lula received the highest number of votes in a Brazilian election, became the first president of Brazil elected to three terms, the first since Getúlio Vargas to serve in non-consecutive terms and also the first candidate to unseat an incumbent president.On 8 January 2023, a week after Lulas inauguration, a mob of Bolsonaros supporters attacked Brazils federal government buildings in the capital, Brasília, after several weeks of unrest. The mob invaded and vandalized the Supreme Federal Court, the National Congress building and the Planalto Presidential Palace in the Three Powers Plaza, seeking to violently overthrow Lula to spur military leaders to launch a coup détat and disrupt the democratic transition of power. In response, Lula announced that he had signed a decree authorising a federal state of emergency in the Federal District.Bolsonaro is "a vocal opponent of same-sex marriage, abortion, affirmative action, drug liberalization, and secularism."Lula "is personally against abortion, but maintains that it should be treated as a public health issue."What do non-Brazilians need to know about the presidency in particular and politics in general?",

Maybe because he was corrupt, maybe because he really hated the PT, or maybe he actually really did believe he could do good by being a justice minister (a truly stupid idea, as everyone who was paying attention knew Bolsonaro would be a disaster and would never care about corruption).I also agree with the idea that the highest profile arrests (and releases) such as Lulas were mostly politically motivated.That being said, I dont think Moro is a CIA agent and I think it is rather sad that the biggest corruption investigation of the history of this country died unceremoniously due to the folly of a few men like Moro. There was true opportunity to change the political culture regarding corruption and it was lost.,",

Imagine Bolsonaro being arrested, the "aunts of zapzap" will just make 200 thousand millions different stories about how were becoming Eurasia on 1984.Its just better to let democracy runs its course, even if it means he could run for president again (which he cant), to antagonize this way, gives power to the narrative of "being persecuted".But yes, Lula is a very good politician, hes the most charismatic president we ever had, this is for sure, like Obama said, the problem in Brazil is that, to make politics, you must "negotiate with the Congress" which usually correspond to money, which then becomes corruption.Lets see how it goes, all in all, I think the Supreme Court should be reformed, life terms is just not fair, I think 8 years mandates would be more than enough, theyre not elected by the people, but they can overrule anything the Congress/President does, its just insane, even from the point of view of "perfect judge" which doesnt exists.,",

Lots of people are willing to overlook corruption because they see him as a good president. And to be fair, his government was one of the most successful ones in the history of Brazil.Add that to the fact that the entire investigation and trial against him were flawed and biased and peoples reaction tends to be "sure he might have done something, but hes the best weve got"I 100% agree that Brazilian politics needs new blood. Almost all relevant politicians nowadays started their careers in the 80s. The main exception would be João Doria, who also flew too close to the sun and destroyed his career.I hope Bolsonaro really disappears from the political landscape but even if he goes to jail Im not sure he will. Maybe Jair will, but his children and bolsonarismo might stay. I hope Im wrong, but I am very pessimistic about it.,",

I think Lula is a great politician, but there’s no way he’s not corrupt, since Mensalão and several other cases, but well, the Supreme Court in Brazil is famous for doing the “free style interpretation of the Constitution”, Dilma for example, was impeached and didn’t lose the political rights for 8 years, this is in the Constitution btw.And then we can argue that her Impeachment was a “unjust one”, but then it’s the same case with Lula, his release was a unjust one, in my opinion, it sends the message that if you got enough powerful friends you can do whatever you want, corruption for the most.About Bolsonaro, well, I think he’s such a small player on the politics of Brazil now, he’s almost going to jail, he lost everything.I think Brazil needs a new political class, younger people, new ideas and projects for the future.

If it is good or bad i will not go in to it, because i dont think giving an opinion is useful to someone trying to understand the scenario, but it is not throughout on long term or from strictly a Brazilian optics.What used to be our popular right was moderate (in a sense) and would take economic approaches that would be considered "safe" while mostly keeping out of social politics when possible, brazil has a history of populist right wing, that meant taking positive social approaches but not for the sake of improvement but for convenience, you need more people to vote, you let woman vote, you need more people to work, you integrate POC in to the market, etc....Our left wing is originally Brazilian in practice with the obvious Marxist-european takes as background, for as much as the extreme right may want to think our left is communist, our popular left wing runs a protectionist center economic take, where you have a relative strong meddling of the state while incentivizing a capitalist economy but still have social burdens placed in it. This means the state is willing to create and protect monopolies that it sees as beneficial but keeps free competition going, without any push to a socialized economy, that state meddling is many times not well thought out nor are the protectionist stands popular in face of the quality of products and services or it takes a "protect workers" that some people find distasteful in its extremes.From the social politics side our left is relatively the standard progressive left, based mostly on equity and non discrimination.That creates a predictable scenario. If you are a bigot you vote far right but if you arent and think the left has no competency you need to at least buy a little bit in to the right discourse, if you dont you cant really justify voting on them given that the current viable right wing option is far right. Meanwhile on the left a lot of people are willing to turn a blind eye to the economic failings that are perceived from the traditional right wing standpoint because the social part of the politics takes precedence, that is one of the reasons of the hold the far right is taking on the Brazilian right wing.This is creating a rift where discourse is starting to become impossible.,",

Those are possibly the 3 most important elements that shape current Brazilian politics. Those three are also *very* controversial, so expect to see diverging opinions. As a disclaimer, my opinions are very different from the usual Brazilian ones.In my opinion, both sides of Brazilian politics were very successful in discrediting the Car Wash investigations. The left seems to believe that it was, at best, a biased anti-left operation, and sometimes even some CIA-backed conspiracy. The right believe the investigations are concluded, but an evil, communist Supreme Court freed Lula. I dont think either are true, but I do agree with the sentiment that the lead judge, Sergio Moro, was biased and made some very stupid political decisions. After Lula was arrested, he decided to become Justice Minister for Bolsonaro, probably thinking it was the opportunity he wanted to clean up politics. Turns out it destroyed all trust and confidence in him and burned out all his political capital. He was once popular enough to become president, if he had tried. When Bolsonaro tried to shield his children from investigations into corruption, he quit the government, thinking hed be popular enough to bring it down, but that wasnt true. He became irrelevant and so did the investigations.I personally believe Dilmas impeachment created a power-vacuum that made it possible for the far-right to rise to power. In theory, she was impeached for very technical reason (*pedaladas fiscais*, also known as magical accounting) that the average Brazilian doesnt understand. The entire Brazilian left thinks it was a coup, whereas the right thinks she deserved it but cant explain why. The truth is that Congress just found the first reason that would pass the legality test for impeaching, and did so for political reasons, because she was utterly incapable of negotiating with Congress, secondly because she tried to shield Lula from investigations by appointing him as her Chief of Staff. She was succeeded by Michel Temer, a centrist who was hated by all. In my opinion, he was a rather good president, at least for Brazilian standards, but most would disagree with me and downvote me for saying it, so take it with a grain of salt. The left hated Temer for being a "a democracy-hating coup-monger," the right would end up hating him because he was associated with some corruption scandals. This led to the center being discredited and to the left mistakenly believing that center-right Brazilians agreed with them that Temer is a coup-monger. Just because everyone hated Temer, it does not mean they hated him for the same reasons. So Lulas Workers Party chose Fernando Haddad as a candidate, with a vice-presidential candidate from the Communist Party, and ran a far-left campaign with the slogan "Lula is Haddad and Haddad is Lula." Unsurprisingly, running a campaign with the slogan "I am literally that person who is sitting in jail now for corruption crimes and I promise to free him if elected" was not particularly popular in a country that despises corruption. This gave way to Bolsonaro being elected and all the chaos that ensued.In my opinion, these things put together have led to enormous division and conflict in Brazilian society and weakening of democratic institutions and norms. Im very pessimistic about the political future of the country. I suggest you do some reading on those three things, and on the economic crisis of 2013 (that I would say continued to this day, tbh). Brazil has experienced *yet another* "lost decade" of economic growth and that has serious political ramifications.If you have any more specific questions, feel free to ask.,",

Here in Brazil we often joke that our government system isnt presidencialism, rather we call it "presidencialismo de coalizões" (what we could translate to "presidencialism of coalitions"), and by that we mean thats impossible to make a government without a comfortable majority in parliament.Then the centrão comes in, they usually always compose the majority of our legislative chambers, meaning any government liking them or not will have to make alliances with them. Those alliances are possible because although they always have a conservative-ish ideology, they exist primarily as a mean to represent the interests of powerful section of Brazilian society. Governments then are obligated to really cater for the interests of the elites, this catering enrich the elites, which in turn secures more funds to centrão parties, which consequently guarantees that those parties monopolise at least the legislative body. Lastly there are a really big number of centrão parties, and they are constantly splitting, merging and rebranding themselves. Consequently even if a party is marked by a big scandal, what could tarnish the interests of a section of the elites, people will have trouble holding accountable those parties electorally, so the centrão preserves itself in power.,",

The thing is that between 2014-16 had a the worst recession in decades and are still recovering from it. However, theres no consense about the causes. The right-wing says that it was caused by excessive intervention on economy on the previous years, while the left-wing blames the neoliberal minister of Finance Joaquim Levy that held the position between the 2014-2016. This divergence makes her lose all her popularity, because even left-wingers abandon her. The economic crises was one of the main reasons because she was impeached. However, that isnt a valid reason to start the process by brazilians laws, so the Parliment used a minor break of fiscal laws that other presidents have already commited as the official justification. This is why the left-wing says it was a parlimentary coup. Years later (2020), the Federal Court of Accounts confirmed that even that minor break was false.Another events that erodes Dilmas aproval was the Lava Jato (Car Wash) operation, that reveals a huge corruption scheme on Petrobras. It involves almost all brazilian parties, however avoids any accusation on PSDB, the main antagonist of Dilmas PT. It was confirmed years later (2019) by Vaza Jato (Jet Leak), which was a series of leaked Telegram chats between judge Sérgio Moro and the prosecutors of Car Wash operation. The messages also confirm that the focus of the operation was to imprison Lula da Silva. About Dilma, its worth to note that none ever proved that she was involved on any corruption case only her party.After the impeachment, Michel Temer became Brazils president and implements the neoliberal agenda on a great scale. One of the main projects was the creation of a spending cap for Brazil government that prohibited any increase on expenses above the inflation for the posterior 20 years. I really dont need to say it became completly unsustainable when the Covid-19 crisis starts on 2020. The Michel Temers term also have a lot of corruption scandals. The most impactful was Carne Fraca (Weak Meat), which reveals a huge squeme involving JBS, one of the most important brazilian raw beef productor. The scandal also reveal that  Aécio Neves, a right-wing politician that was beaten by Dilma on 2014, was involved and willing to kill one of his cousins to keep the scheme on secret.Michel Temer manages to have a lowest aproval rating than Dilma Rouseff, with only 4%.With both teadition left and right demoralized, Bolsonaro rised abruptaly on 2018 and achives more than 40% on the first round of brazilian ellections. The consequence of her presidence are well know to you.Some compliments, but many people just have ignored it;n- When Bolsonaro voted for Dilmas impeachment, he prests homage to Brilhante Ustra, the general who tortured Dilma during the Militar Dictatorship.",",

We vote based on the person we think it’s going to steal less and do something good for the people, but we already expect they are going to be corrupt.

Commodity producer, over-explored global south country, with an economic elite of 0.01% who owns over half of the country’s wealth and of course has immense political power over every official decision.And at that point you might really consider what difference does it make if the economic elite decided to fund this candidate or that candidate enough so they’ll win the election. Political decisions are all taken by big capital owners and are always headed in the same direction, only the acceleration speed might vary a bit.,",

Then Portugals prince declared independence and formed an empire in Brazil under his rule.Then, a military coup took over in 1889. The coup was led by conservative land and slave owners who wanted to ensure their privileges, as slavery was ending in most places around the world.The country entered an unstable, corrupt republic, with strong eugenist, religious (Catholic) influence, and other ideas today associated with conservative parties. The government neglected most regions except Southeast for most of the 20th Century after that.Then came a populist leader, Getúlio Vargas, who got to power. He was a Nazi. Because of him and his "court", Brazil almost joined the Axis in WWII. His rule also had the traits associated with todays Christian conservative right wing.After him, there was the "populist republic", Pres. Dutra and others, who were right wing, conservative, and religious as well. Dutra openly adopted policies based on religious dogma. Also neglected most regions, also eugenist. Illiteracy was rampant in the country.Then, military dictatorship, brutal, violent, merciless, backed by the USA. Conservative, religious, anti-commie, right wing.Then, a frail democracy after 1985. It was a sequency of highly corrupt, innefficient, horrible governments that caused and worsened hyper-inflation and other issues. They were mostly right wing as well.Lula was the first left wing government in Brazil since the beginning. Some of his policies caused a huge shock in the system. Other regions besides the South East were extremely pauper at this point; starvation and disease were rampant. He came up with a few systems of redistribution of wealth, and helped the development of many of these neglected regions, among other things.But, his government enforced drastic investigations on corruption, which also caused the fall of many members of the government, including his own party. Mensalão and other scandals were associated with his image. The economy worsened after 2008, Dilma Rousseff, who was supposed to continue Lulas direction, was impeached, and the government fell once again in the hands of right wing, conservative, eugenist old, white, rich men who descend from the slave owners of the 19th Century.Bolsonaro was the greatest bet of these people, supposed to be the perfect puppet to pull back all social progress brought by the left. But, he was actually an absolute moron, so even the old rich men, the conservatives, land owners, wealth hoarders, started to drift away from him. He fell in the last election, but just barely.Internet came in the mid 2000s, polarization ensues, and now, Brazil went back to the left wing, though most of the congress is conservative right wing.Truth be told, most Brazilians enjoy a good tyrant, a "firm hand" grabbing them by the balls, even if it hurts.

As you pointed out Lula is notorious by his diplomacy and influence over international politics. Bolsonaro, on the other hand, is infamous for almost instantly destroying any respect world leaders had for Brazil. Bolsonaro was seen literally being ignored and put aside by other world leaders, lost arrangements already in place and approached Brazil with non-democratic states. Meanwhile, Lula was meeting world leaders in Europe after getting released, before elections even started. So you can expect Brazil to recover some of its influence, and there are already official international meetings where Lula stood out. Other things that may affect you is environmental policy. Lula was not particularly good to the environment, his policy was one of growth and development and environmental concerns come second. But Bolsonaros policy was one of active destruction and plundering of whatever the land had to offer.

But now all this evidence is out there and her name is circulating. There’s almost no chance she will ever match in the future . Personally I feel like all those who got caught cheating should not have the opportunity to repeat and the fact that NBME is allowing them to do it over is way more grace than I would have given.,,

But we all know that wont happen cause everything looks like she freaking cheated all the way...",

uknight92, t2_3u99lj6v, t1_ks507eb, t1_ks3kzl0, 02/25/24 18:15, 22, 0, The court opinion pointed out that the plaintiff didn’t provide any evidence that she was offered interviews and they inferred that she didn’t as it would have strengthened her argument of irreparable harm. I don’t believe NBME asserted she didn’t get any. Getting an interview would very likely not have changed the courts reasoning on the balance of equities if you read the opinion they practically said as much. They thought a theoretical individual already in a residency who was a part of this group with unvalidated scores would have the best chance of a stay but they didn’t state an opinion on that as no named plaintiff belonged to that group. At any rate this was all just their reasoning to grant or deny a preliminary injunction on score invalidation. They have not decided the merit of the suit. The court is clearly very skeptical of the plaintiffs’ arguments and it seems very unlikely she’d succeed if this goes to trial no matter how many interviews she had.,

phoenixdou, t2_szyly4si, t1_ks3kzl0, t3_1azugho, 02/25/24 13:16, 2, 0, Yes so other 831 nepalis chose to be quiet. She sued for 80 millions for losing chance to match this year. But NBME said she didnt get any interview yet. NBME communicated with ERAS? Imaging if she got at least 1 interview she might win 80m!!, 
Mental_Progress_7982, t2_g6g8gohv, t1_ks4ls78, t1_ks449ho, 02/25/24 13:16, 48, 0, even if its 1 exam that was invalidated the court document states that the previous invalidation remains on the transcript. Its a big enough scandal now I think that every PD knows that the invalidation was rooted in a cheating scandal. So even if someone who only has 1 exam to remake still manages to pull through for when you start applying I dont think any PD would send them an invite. Dont lost any sleep over it and do your own best ,

Mental_Progress_7982, t2_g6g8gohv, t1_ks3x2c8, t3_1azugho, 02/25/24 14:25, 1, 0, you do realise all 3 of her exams were invalidated? she would have to write them 1 per year at a center designated by the NBME and an exam curated for her by the NBME. The process itself to remediate these exams is 3 years no less. I have posted this from the court documents before... She has already lost so nothing more to lose by suing. ​as they say... a drowing man clutches at straws, 
Biryani_Wala, t2_i30ut14f, t1_ks7d5kd, t1_ks7b5hd, 02/25/24 14:25, 46, 0, They had 95 percent of the questions. She wasnt getting a 220, 
Temporary-Molasses-1, t2_7pxuyf7h, t1_ks7b5hd, t1_ks5t66t, 02/26/24 06:33, 1, 0, She would pass. She is intelligent baseline. YES she got a boost by cheating but she will at least get a 220. Its like saying Armstrong is not a good cyclist because he was caught doping.",

Creepy-Tomatillo-451, t2_u0j3spglm, t1_ks5e72m, t1_ks46n8k, 02/25/24 21:25, 0, 0, Dr. Carmody on twitter said that she would just need to pass and from there she could argue that her score falls with 1-2 standard deviation of her old score and she could have a psychiatrist testify that she was nervous and anxious taking the exam this time compared to her first time and that would explain the score discrepancy., 
Pakistani-USMLE, t2_e73x5wbpd, t1_ks46n8k, t3_1azugho, 02/25/24 15:20, 11, 0, I believe all 3 of her steps were actually invalidated and since she didnt study in the first place . Doing all 3 steps and getting a similar kind of results to satisy nbme was near to impossible for her.\nShe took a gamble which obviously didnt pay off..,

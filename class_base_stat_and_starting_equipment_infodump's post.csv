, t2_fpv4w, t3_18g811y, , 12/11/23 18:48, 18, 0, Notes- I'm not going to include EVERY attribute for each class just the ones I find the most noteworthy. Hobo- Lowest base focus at 3 and one of the worst starting weapons. 6 damage is terrible for the upper limit and it can still completely whiff.  It's innately armor piercing but that isn't as impactful in early fights. . Has the highest perfect accuracy at 70% but that's by virtue of it being a single roll. If the hobo gets shocked he literally cannot do damage. Definitely a weapon you want to get rid of a soon as possible. Base 70s are actually kinda terrible. You can use any weapon but every weapon is just meh on you. To really hammer in how bad base 70 is vs base 76. On a 3 roll weapon you are looking at 34.3% vs 44% perfect accuracy. And these numbers just get worse the more rolls there are. The combination of lowest base focus, bad main stats and no passives make its rough out here for the hobo. That being said, Hobo does have good speed and fortitude which is a niche at least.Pathfinder\\-Pretty average base stats, middling hp and focus. Her weapon is odd. 2-6 on a single target it is tied for second worse base damage on a weapon. While the single target damage is bad, she does have access to row attack. Doing 4 damage to up to 4 targets. This still isn't a lot of damage but combined with an attack candy or gloves you can do 20-24 damage spread out to 4 targets. Also is a support range weapon that is also one handed. Pathfinder has the highest talent in the game which is hugely useful for ship movement and bombs. Survey is immensely useful for pathing letting you better utilize sanctums and stone heroes. With 76 awareness and talent she can utilize both types of weapons adequately but being slanted toward talent is great since it allows you to better utilize gambesons for gold generation. In combat she doesn't have any skills but her high talent makes her the best bomb user which is very valuable. She is also serviceably fast at 70 speed. Blacksmith\\-Highest base hp at 40. 4-9 base damage is very respectable but it is a 4 roll, which means she only has a 37% chance to actually hit that 9 damage. But she also starts with a shield and can stun. Pretty decent equipment all things considered. The main draws of blacksmith is her MONSTROUS hp. She also has the highest base fortitude giving her the most accurate taunts in the game. She is the slowest character in the game however but eager helps a lot here. She also has 74 strength allowing her to use strength weapons which is a boon. Steadfast isn't something you can plan around, its more like nice that saved me some health. But considering how many hits she'll be taking with taunt it's not a bad passive.Alchemist-Lowest base hp at 30 and highest base focus at 5. 2-6 base damage is miserable, and this is compounded as it doesn't even have an aoe attack to make it better like the cracked rang. It does ignore armor and has support range which is nice. This is one of the weapons that you want to replace as soon as possible. Alchemist is the second fastest character in the game at 76 speed. And as staves are so powerful a quick blast could easily oneshot an enemy and soften up another. Create potion is super misleading since it gives bombs. But bombs are amazing adding so much damage in a pinch. With his 70 talent he is also serviceable at throwing bombs.Stablehand-Lowest base hp and average focus. 2-6 is atrocious and it isn't even innately armor piercing you'd need to use stab for that. To make the wooden sword even worse its a two roll as opposed to the hobos 1 roll. This is arguably the worst starting weapon in the game. Stablehand has the highest speed in the game at 78 and second highest strength at 74. He basically cannot use any weapons other than strength weapons however, hardwork is one of the strongest skills in the game since it has a hard condition vs a random chance like most passives. The combination of dancing nettle and focus pipes could net near infinite turns. In fact stablehand turns all the meh herbs into actions with a focus pipe. However because stablehand only really has strength to fall back on he doesn't get access to many support range weapons. The main ones he will get are cannons which gut his speed and speed bows which have low base damage and are relatively rare.Scholar-Lowest base hp and highest focus similar to the alchemist.  Dusty tome is one of the best starting weapons. Very respectable base damage at 3-8 on a 3 roll for 47.5% perfect accuracy. What makes this weapon so powerful is that it has blast allowing you to deal half damage on adjacent squares. With a magic candy and some gloves you are doing 5-10 to the main target and 3-5 to the sides. Meaning you can potentially deal 25 damage to the enemy team. This weapon is significantly better than cracked rang since it has higher single target damage allowing you to focus fire a target and still deal decent aoe damage. With cracked rang if you aren't hitting 4 targets, row attack is pretty awful, area blast in comparison is always good to throw out. Also a support range weapon and two handed. With the highest intelligence at 78 scholar has the most accurate spells in the game. Refocus is also one of the best skills in the game, allowing scholar to be much more liberal with the use of his focus. 74 talent also means he could dip into the physical side with talent weapons but even without that he is a great person to have your bombs on. Shepard-38 base hp is quite high, tied for second with the other base 38s. Average focus. 3-8 on a 4 roll is not great equating to only 33% perfect accuracy. But 8 damage is 8 damage. Also her weapon grants 2 armor and is two handed. High fortitude and awareness is an interesting combination. She also has 70 intelligence but that's not that useful. She has low speed at 64 which isn't good. Sheep are kinda useless, the only have 1 hp and don't even shield the back line. In fact it can even be detrimental if you are trying to position your tank away from the team. You know when you have a sheep though and if it can occasionally soak up a hit that is still useful. Shepard is very robust with 76 fortitude but her lackluster skill does hurt her.Friar-38 base hp and 5 focus seems like cheating to be honest. Also has a 3-9 base damage weapon on a 3 roll that can cast cure. Compared to the blacksmith, friar has 43.9% perfect accuracy to blacksmiths 37% on the same damage cap. 76 fortitude and intelligence is an amazing combination, giving you access to all the support spells you could want and having high hp and accurate taunts. 60 base speed is slow as hell but the utility of having access to fortitude and intelligence weapons cannot be understated. Find alcohol is very useful especially since friar is immune to the negative effects of alcohol. But of note is that spreading alcohol still applies the negative effects. But the ability to apply faher mule to your party is insane. The versatility of alcohol makes friar immensely powerful. Also because of friar's intelligence it is possible to run high resistance gear on him and have a resistance tank with high hp. Woodcutter-Base 32 hp and average focus. Wood axe has the absolute highest damage of any starting weapon coming in at a staggering 5-12. It is a 5 roll giving it only a 28.9% perfect accuracy. Woodcutter has the highest base strength at 78, good awareness at 74 and isn't agonizingly slow at 66. Still slow but at least you will likely go before the super heavy units. Justice is random but does add very nice aoe damage to the already high damage dealing strength weapons but it only applies to two handed weapons which does hurt. The high awareness allows woodcutter to switch to a support range weapon if necessary and it's always useful to have a second high stat to use the equipment you get.Farmer-38 base hp and average focus. Pitchfork has a very respectable damage range of 4-10 and can even thrust for good aoe damage. But pitchfork is a 5 roll giving it 22.2% perfect accuracy. At 74 strength/fortitude/awareness, farmer can do most of anything on the physical side other than talent stuff. This combination of high stats means farmer will basically always be getting weapon upgrades since he can use damn near everything. The awareness also gives access to support range. Woodcutter is very robust and hits hard with basically anything. Scarecrows are kind of awkward. While they do shield the back rank, their summoning is random and and whether or not they take a hit is a roll of the dice. While sheep do not shield and only have one hp at least you know when you have access to them, the random nature of scare crows really does hurt the ability. Farmer also has abysmal speed at 60 which is painfully slow. At that point you might even go after the super heavies.Herbalist-32 base hp and 5 focus. Walking stick has a base damage of 3-7 which is pretty bad considering its a 4 roll, two handed weapon. Offers support range and cure but its perfect accuracy is still 33.4% pretty low for 7 damage. 76 intelligence/awareness gives her some decent options for a backliner letting her have her pick of either physical or magical damage. She also 58 fortitude which is fairly high for a non friar intelligence character. But this is all offset by her abysmal 62 speed, which is pretty much unsalvageable. Find herb is odd. Some herbs like golden roots or godsbeards are amazing but then you have herbs like hermit grass and dancing nettle which can be good but aren't as obviously useful as the prior herbs. Add to this it seems(this is just my findings) that find herb has the lowest proc rate. Compared to find scroll/bomb/alcohol find herb happens the most infrequently. So while occasional free herbs is very powerful it is tempered by the caveats of the ability. Party heal is incredibly strong but there are also a few asterisks to this ability. The biggest issue with party heal is once you find a healing wand or any other party heal granting equipment, herbalists party heal loses immense value. The fact that a random drop can invalidate a huge portion of herbalists unique skill is detrimental to the power of this skill. That being said the ability to party heal in combat is phenomenal, since party heal equipment tends to be on the weaker side. But there are caveats here again. First off positioning for this ability can be problematic since it can only heal adjacent squares very often herbalist would have to reposition first to heal. This means that having nimble to grant her another bonus action is helpful but with her 64 talent she is pretty terrible at chucking bombs meaning she might won't always have a good use for her two bonus actions. Clustering together also runs into the issues of getting slammed by aoes. Especially against super heavies clustering together to get a full value party heal could lead to you getting 4 man slammed. Party heal also does not heal as much as a normal heal which makes it less powerful when you just have one person seriously damaged. So while party heal is a very powerful ability there are some things to consider when using it.Hunter-30 base hp and average focus. 2-6 base damage is terrible especially with no gimmick to help alleviate that low base damage like pierce or aoe. At a 2 roll simple bow has a 60.8% perfect accuracy which is tied with stable hand for the second most accurate perfect roll but that 6 damage isn't scaring anyone. The bow does have support range but that's basically it, it's pierce function is laughably bad. Hunter has the highest awareness at 78 but similarly to stablehand doesn't have any other stat to fall back on. This can be problematic since his base weapon is so bad and it can be hard to find a decent awareness weapon. The 10 foot pole can help a bit in this regard but that is load out points you are losing for a VERY mediocre weapon. Hunter is the 3rd fastest at 74(how the mighty have fallen). Elite sneak/ambush isn't something I have gotten much value from. The risk of the enemy getting free actions is pretty scary. Energy boost is decently useful, i really wish it gave it to you at the START of your turn vs after you have used all your movement but extra movement is never bad. Called shot is an awkward ability. it basically gives you a free crit but only with bows. The free crit is very nice but compared to justice or hardwork, this seems like the weakest of the damage skills. Hunter has other abilities to make up for it but it really does suck to sink focus into an attack just to get the called shot proc. ConclusionHope you guys get a use out of this information. The info the game presents you is definitely lacking so I thought this would be cool to have. If you disagree with how I evaluated something feel free to yell at me down below. Cheers!, 
Erectorz, t2_fpv4w, t1_kd1cis7, t1_kczkrb9, 12/11/23 18:48, , 0, Like i said It just seemed like herbalist didnt get as many procs on her ability I had no idea it was the same it was probably just bad luck on her procs specifically.I undervalued speed weapons ill try that out.Ill have to try farmer some more because scarecrow just felt kinda meh. Steadfast also didnt feel really good to be fair.Thanks for the feedback. I am eager to try out some of the ideas other people have.", 
coldhotshot, t2_bhwil, t1_kczkrb9, t3_18g811y, 12/11/23 21:59, 1, 0, Great write up good summary of the classes strengths and weaknesses in the beginning of the game from their equipment decent write up on the different abilities and insightful look at the stt spread.There are a few things I disagree with due to learning from the discord on ability interactions and equipment drops.Herbalist find herb has the same proc chance as all the other find skills they do need to be not on the boat and in an area with the current active quest. So that maybe why you have less proc chance for them but all the find x skills are all the same.I dont understand the stablehand unable to use speed weapons there is a shock sword in the loadout shop which is a perfect weapon for the stablehand and makes speed a great stat to spec into. There are goblin knives and with speed evasion is able to be built however strength and strength armor has no evasion equipment so its impossible to spec into evasion (where evasion is better than armor/resistance especially in the end game)  when going strength (which is a problem for woodcutters)Farmers build scarecrow ability is actually pretty consistent compared to steadfast on Balcksmith because steadfast only works on physical attacks and taunt no longer gives a physical and magical defense boost. So a farmer will get more from their ability due to a 35% chance to proc build scarecrow but overall they are the same as blacksmith as a class that needs eager as well.", 
Erectorz, t2_fpv4w, t1_kd1bz7b, t1_kczlclv, 12/12/23 08:51, 2, 0, yeah it seems like i was undervaluing speed weapons ill try out speed stuff on him next time., 
Educational_Return_5, t2_7km6860j, t1_kczlclv, t3_18g811y, 12/11/23 22:03, 1, 0, For stablehand Speed weapons are viable. They pierce so they always do max damage and getting max speed on him only requires a few items which lets you wear +DMG gear. Not to mention that speed gear has evasion which is arguably the best defense. You can get 60+ easily and then use evade for 100% dodge chance., 
MrBoof100, t2_t8de2vs, t1_kcz3qus, t1_kcz1rzf, 12/11/23 22:03, 3, 0, Whoops. What’s the drink to get another primary action? I want the devs to fix that, 
Erectorz, t2_fpv4w, t1_kcz1rzf, t1_kcz08jr, 12/11/23 20:03, 1, 0, mules give +attack buff, 
MrBoof100, t2_t8de2vs, t1_kcz08jr, t3_18g811y, 12/11/23 19:39, 1, 0, Quick note about friar. I haven’t played in 2-3 weeks so maybe this changed. I believe the fahrule mule is the booze that gives another primary attack (sorry if I’m wrong here). I’ve got a 4 man friar game going and I’m almost positive the spreading of +1 primary attack doesn’t actually spread. Please correct me if the recent updates fixed this though. When I played the ability procs and it shows the other character getting the +1 primary but then on that other character’s turn still had one primary., 
ddaveo, t2_lenah, t1_kd4txwz, t1_kd1bves, 12/11/23 19:39, 1, 0, I can recommend trying it for sure. The stablehand is less about heavy damage and more about debuffs. Having said that though the alternate attack on each speed weapon is armour-piercing so in practice he often hits higher than the "heavy" classes because their attacks get blunted by armour and his doesn\t.I suggest starting the stablehand with the shock sword and used goblin wraps if you have them. By the final dungeon you want him to have 60+ evasion a focus pipe a range of poison/bleed/shock knives a buckler with "evade up group" ability (if you can find it) and a ton of panax. He\ll easily perform on par with the basic strength classes., 
Erectorz, t2_fpv4w, t1_kd1bves, t1_kczry8u, 12/12/23 22:34, 1, 0, I havent found many speed weapons worth using. The base damage of speed weapons are pretty low compared to strength but maybe i wasnt paying attention to them. And using a status weapon is a pretty cool idea ill have to try that out.", 
ddaveo, t2_lenah, t1_kczry8u, t3_18g811y, 12/11/23 22:50, 1, 0, > He basically cannot use any weapons other than strength weapons howeverThats not right. Stablehand is wasted with strength weapons. I find hes best with knives or even just the shock sword for the entire run. Give him the junk herbs and let him poison or shock every opponent on the grid before anyone else even gets a turn. Give him all the high speed/evasion gear you find and hell hardly ever get hit either.Or alternatively give him the lucky trait and the black cat and he can swap to the toy hammer when you find it in a night market. With 95 luck he can stun/confuse most your opponents right at the start of the fight which is invaluable in fights against higher level opponents.", 
Cryoptic-, t2_tuauf8he, t1_kda0uyr, t1_kd7qfsp, 12/11/23 22:50, 1, 0, They can be interpreted the same way. Often used interchangeably however the game clearly uses vitality for the name. Not a huge issue but thought I’d mention it , 
Erectorz, t2_fpv4w, t1_kd7qfsp, t1_kd6asbf, 12/13/23 23:02, 1, 0, .......I really thought it was fortitude. I have no idea why its clearly vitality, 
Cryoptic-, t2_tuauf8he, t1_kd6asbf, t3_18g811y, 12/13/23 08:06, 1, 0, Not that it matters a whole lot but man did it annoy me to read fortitude instead of vitality haha.Also doesn’t the friar start with a INT mace that is physical and an INT shield?,

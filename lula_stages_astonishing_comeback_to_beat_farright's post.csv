But the idea isnt just "fuck Bolsonaro", its back to normality, back to democracy, back to respecting the institutions.Its unlikely this will be an effective government because a lot of people in Congress will go against him and hell have to be very careful with the decisions he makes to avoid being ousted like Dilma was, everyone will be watching closely and left-leaning leaders are taken out of office much more easily than what was going on with Bolsonaro, who collected responsibility crimes throughout his 4 years as president but no one dared to try to take him out and the Congress leader was his supporter so he never let anyone even *vote* to get him out.As for your fear that Lula will support Russia, I think thats highly unlikely. Lula is diplomatic and likes to work with Western countries, unlike Bolsonaro who just picked a fight with pretty much everyone. Even if he *personally* favors Russia, hell listen to advisors and side with whoever will be best for Brazil. Thats one of the major issues of Bolsonaros diplomacy, hed just tell them to fuck off because he thought Brazil didnt need anyone and couldnt be bossed around, which is pretty dumb on a global perspective.

I do not know if they are in their chronological order, but they dont seem to. They seem, in fact, taken from its context to be brought in the order intended by the news editor to issue his/her opinion or influence. They do not seem to be incorrect however, I must admit.So I think that the whole thing started during the pandemic when Bolsonaro himself kind of asked people to start taking chloroquine without any medical prescription. Even the army started producing it locally and it already had purchase orders from the government. A lot of public money was poured in producing a medicine that was shortly later confirmed as inefficient against Covid. Bolsonaros hand was on it and nobody could do a thing at the time. Period.From there things escalated and Public Institutions such as the Parliament and the Supreme Court began to be threatened over by all kinds of people on social media. The Court then produced an alteration on its internal regulation to authorize opening investigations over fake news on its own, specially some related to digital attacks and threats on public institutions such as the Parliament and the Supreme Court as well as others. It did not usurp the power of investigation of the Attorney General or the Federal Public Ministry (which he heads), they just shrugged over the matter. The attorney general is also a political ally to Bolsonaro.I think Ive read that the Court authorized stuff without warrants... Im not sure but if it said so in the article its a point blank lie. Even if the investigation was opened by the court itself regarding national security threats, it certainly had its due process and warrants issued, otherwise how would the police authorities been able to search homes and businesses and etc? We see that all the time in movies how it is in the US so, indeed, sounds very much strange coming straight out of the NY Times.Anyway... its not the first time we have "freedom of speech" problems. Example, regarding an old case of some n@zi teens stuff in some of our southern states. The Supreme Court, it seems to me, only applied the same kind jurisprudence over the new case now regarding national security and threats to democracy. They had the right to speech alright, but they were effectively coordinating a sort of coup against Lula should he be elected then.He is elected now! Some WhatsApp groups of truck drivers intend to play a major strike this week believing to have the necessary political force to reverse results of the election. So... these absurdities, unfortunately, will always be present. A strike can be legal, ok, but strikers have to do so in due form of law. Those people planning a coup clearly werent, and thats the point. The truck drivers who may be sad over the results may sleep soundly tonight, knowing their phones wont be confiscated nor their accounts blocked due to planning a strike. So in my point of view, that is the difference, see?But well... the judicialization of politics is not new in Brazil, and it seems to me that certainly some segments of the US society do not wish the top justices meddling on internal political affairs over there as it happens here.I hope to have clarified you.

It is NOT that he is the good guy or a favorite... anyway ups, the feeling is not much of happiness, but indeed of relief.The fact is that he, Lula, has been sued for corruption by a judge that had been very much dishonest in the whole process which culminated in the Supreme Court of Brazil of effectively stating his trial as nullified, been the process sent back to lower judicial instances to be restarted.Bolsonaro, on his turn, has been investigated by the Brazilian Parliament (and the Parliament only!) and, among many atrocities, senators found that the government was charging bribes of $1 per vaccine bought from foreign labs during negotiations at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. He and his sons, who also occupy public positions, have been involved in other corruption cases but never were any of them investigated due to his influence as president, as well as his privilege of constitutional protection of being shielded from any investigation while in office.The whole election has shown that all stances of Brazils politics, whoever were the candidates, is somewhat and somehow involved in some kind of corruption affair. Lula was arrested in 2018 for being found guilty in that process, thus he could not be a candidate for those elections. Bolsonaro won specially because Lula couldnt compete. The scenario could have been very much different had Lula been a candidate (or not, it is impossible to determine that now). Bolsonaros speech reaches directly those people who believe that no negotiation is needed for solving the countrys problems; that simply disconsidering the whole representation system, a god-sent president can, with support of its followers gathered on social media, rule out all corruption and misconduct from the public services and grant the nations welfare granted simplyby his word. A childs belief, nonetheless, for only a very childlike innocent constituent could believe such an ideal.So, Lula is no saint, but at least he shows better intentions. His personal flaws are not mine as his constituent - he has to pay for any crimes he commit,  but he must be fairly investigated and tried... His adversary, on the other hand, has the federal attorney general as his ally to shield him from being subject to ANY investigation, while the president himself applies 100-year secrecy decrees to matters that are not of national security but simply personally dear to him.Im terribly relieved that Bolsonaro already has a date to come out of office...

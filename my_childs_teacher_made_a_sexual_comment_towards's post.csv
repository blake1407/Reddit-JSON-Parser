He told her that as she grows into a young lady she‚Äôs going to fill out very nicely & said hes excited to see her growth over time. I was enraged. I dont want her going to this school anymore & I want to report this teacher. My husband said the comment shouldn‚Äôt be taken too seriously because it was just a ‚Äújoke‚Äù. He said a report like this could ruin the teachers whole life. My husband said not to ruin the guys life because our daughter is already going to be leaving the school. He also thinks this guy could target our family if he finds out that he was reported & it could turn into a potentially dangerous situation.I ABSOLUTELY think the comment should be taken seriously regardless. Would I be an AH to go against my husbands wishes & just report it even though she will no longer be attending that school? This is putting a lot of stress on me.",,

If the dad convinces her that what her teacher said wasn‚Äôt that bad (it was) and if/when she gets into a situation like this in the future she might not have developed that thing all women should possess in their gut‚Äîthat thing you should listen to that tells you to walk away5.

I immediately sent her to the office to report the incident and followed up with it with the administrators. There is no guy code or teacher code that would hold me back from reporting the guy.

Staying quiet keeping the peace leads to kids not knowing how/when to advocate for themselves because it will upset others.

The more people let these perverts get away with the more theyll do. So your daughters leaving soon what about the next girl he targets? What will he do to her or the ones after? It shouldnt have to progress for it to be stomped out. I work in a school theres safe guarding for major outside and inside incidents and theres safe guarding for minor inside incidents. They vary in name but usually along the lines of people of concern or individuals who have displayed worrying behaviour. If hes openly said this Id guess theres other complaints out there.",

When I was 19 multiple family friends were over. Their kids varied in ages but there were two 13 year olds. They asked for a hug and I gave them a hug. And then they kept asking for it and I heard them discuss that they wanted to feel boobs. They thought they were being so discrete. I was so uncomfortable. They chased me around the backyard trying to hug me. I told my bf at the time and he was like ‚Äúthey‚Äôre just teens. It‚Äôs harmless. Let them‚Äù and some other stuff. And I felt so bad. Like maybe I overreacted. I was so embarrassed that I didn‚Äôt tell my parents. And I really should have. I feel safe around my parents and can talk to them about anything. But ex put it in my mind that I was overreacted probably and was going to the friendship my parents have with their parents. \nThose boys turned into shitty men. I‚Äôll never forgive my ex for this. Just because those boys were younger doesn‚Äôt mean they didn‚Äôt realize what they were doing is fucked up. Anyway some men support other men. Even if they‚Äôve never met them don‚Äôt know anything about them and aren‚Äôt even friends. People like my ex and OP‚Äôs husband are shitty men and the reason why predators get away with things. They will always support other men over SA.,

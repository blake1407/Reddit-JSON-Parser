My family and I want to my uncles for Christmas. When I arrived I went to his bar to make myself a drink. Im very calculated with my drinks. I measure it out and even use a tracker to count my drinks, along with their alcohol content and time to finish them. I measured out 2 ounces of Vodka and poured in some carbonated water he had from his soda stream, with just a splash of cola for flavor.  After I was about a quarter of the way through I felt a good buzz. Much more than I should. I figured it was due to the carbonated water I was drinking. I feel like carbonation in alcohol makes you absorb it faster. Im later talking to my uncle and he tells me about his soda stream and that when you carbonate alcohol, you have to wait for the cloudiness to dissipate. He was refilling one of the bottles and I interrupted him, ""Those are the bottles youre using for vodka?"" He says yes, and I realize my fuck up.  I had reached into the mini fridge and grabbed some unmarked bottles assuming they were water. So, it seems I had actually poured myself a vodka and vodka. At this point I was over half way done with my drink. I had consumed over 8 ounces of vodka in a half hour. That is about the same as 64 ounces of beer. . It was Christmas so I might as well be drunk with the family. We all had a good laugh. I recalibrated the rest of my drink, finishing it over the course of the rest of the night. &#x200B;. TL;DR: I made myself a vodka and vodka, mistaking what I thought was carbonated water was actually vodka"

tifu,dabrothergoose,t2_hlq11,t3_18sbj5f,,12/27/23 16:20,0,1044,0.9,126,"""TIFU by attempting to impress my crush with an elaborate homemade dinner.. I spent hours preparing a fancy three-course meal, complete with candles and soft music. Everything was going smoothly until I realized I had mixed up salt and sugar in the dessert. As my crush took a bite of the chocolate mousse, her expression changed from anticipation to horror. Trying to save the moment, I nervously took a bite too, only to confirm that I had created a culinary disaster. We both politely tried to hide our disgust, but it was evident that the dessert was a complete failure. To make matters worse, my attempt to salvage the evening by ordering a replacement dessert ended up with the delivery person accidentally ringing the neighbors doorbell thinking it was my house, causing an awkward interaction with the neighbor. My crush and I shared a few forced laughs, but the romantic atmosphere was irreversibly shattered. As the night progressed and I wanted to drive her home, I discovered I had also accidentally locked my keys inside my car, leading to an embarrassing call to a locksmith. What was supposed to be a charming evening turned into a series of mishaps, leaving me with the title of the most disastrous date planner in history. TL;DR: Mixed the sugar up for salt in the dessert causing a terrible chocolate mousse. Tried to fix it by ordering dessert delivered they confused it for the neighbor’s house, and locked my keys in my car when I wanted to give my crush a ride home. Next time I’ll just take her out to dinner."

But first, I ended up here because I decided to take my mom on vacation to Europe for Christmas. . She’s never been outside of the United States and I figured it was about time to change that. . Since she’s a teacher and doesn’t have much money, I promised her I could get her to Europe for cheap with flight miles and then got her a travel credit card! . And over the last year, we had both collectively earned enough points to get us there and back for free (minus some taxes ofc) . The plan was to fly into Rome, go to Amsterdam, and then fly back from Amsterdam after spending a few days in each city. . Problem is, when I booked us our flights from Rome to Amsterdam, I was in full dumbass mode and booked them for January 29 2024 instead of December 29 2023. . I found this out when I got to the airport and the lady checking our bags noticed my mistake. This was really awesome news to hear and I felt really smart for getting into this situation. . $1000 later, I got us both flights to Amsterdam that won’t interrupt our availability to get back to the US.   . Now, my New Year’s resolution for 2024 is to pay closer attention to details. TL;DR I took my mom and I to Europe for free but I learned an expensive lesson."

Take Ryanair for example, you dont check in 6 hours before the flight? No problem just pay £150 for all 4 passengers for me to type your details into this little computer."""

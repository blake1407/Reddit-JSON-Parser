Last night, returning from a late shift, I didnt want to wake my roommates, so I figured Id just ninja my way through my window. Ive done it before, no biggie. I climb in, feeling like a stealthy cat, only to freeze at the sight of a couple staring at me from their couch, mid-movie munch. Wrong window, wrong apartment, two floors down. Im in full panic mode, spewing apologies and trying to explain that Im not some weird burglar, just a very confused neighbor. They were surprisingly chill about it, but I could tell they were holding back laughter. I clambered back out, now officially the accidental cat burglar of the block. Im considering baking them an apology cake.  or maybe just using my front door from now on. &#x200B;. TL;DR: Last night, thought I was ninja-ing into my apartment through the window, ended up in the wrong place."

I lived on the third floor in my building and all the apartments look exactly the same. . I walked up the stairs and opened “my” apartment door, stepped inside, and went to stomp the snow off my feet. Only, my door mat was gone. I stood there a second and thought, “what the hell? Someone stole my door mat from inside my apartment?” . Still a little confused I saw a picture on the wall that was obviously not of me or my kids and then realized I had stepped inside of the second floor apartment. I quietly picked up my bags and closed the door and then made as much noise as possible stomping up to MY floor and apartment so that if my neighbors had heard me come inside their apartment they’d hopefully know what happened. I felt so stupid. . I talked to my neighbor below me the next day and apologized for the mistake. He laughed and said he knew what had happened, and said he needs to get better about locking his door at night. . It’s funny because I now always look at my apartment number before entering, no matter where I live."""

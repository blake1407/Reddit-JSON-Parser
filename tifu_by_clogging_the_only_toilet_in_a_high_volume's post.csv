Yesterday, the day after Boxing Day I decided I wanted to go down to Maine (from Canada) to do some shopping at Harbour freight. . We live about 5 hours from the harbour freight so we hit the road around 5:30 am. 3 ish hours into the trip and just a few kms from the turn off to the border we decided to stop at a small truck stop that had a Tim’s in the parking lot, get some coffee and use the bathroom. I’ve needed to poop since I woke up so once we parked I headed to the bathroom. Most Tim’s don’t have a particularly big bathroom, this one was no exception. Two stalls, one with a toilet and the other with a urinal, yes, I dont know why there was a urinal stall either. Like most truck stop/ rest stop bathrooms, they’re not that clean so I had to wipe piss off the seat. I’ll skip some details because we’ve all taken poops before, this one was no different. But while I was pooping (5 minutes tops) probably 6 people were in and out, one of those 6 people obviously needed to use the toilet as I eventually observed someone waiting by the sink huffing and puffing and coughing as if to say “I’m waiting” so I took that as a hint to hurry up. . I start to clean up, flush, put my jacket on, go to leave and I see the water is a bit discoloured. no poop, no tp just a little brown water, you know what I mean. I like to think of myself as a decent human, I wouldn’t leave my piss on the seat so I’m not going to leave the water all dirty for the cranky man outside the stall, so I flush again. Bad idea, it starts fill up higher than it should. Okay, flush again, surely that’ll fix it. Oh fuck, it’s up to the top of the seat… I grab the plunger, trying not to splash the water too bad as it is actually filled to the brim. This plunger has clearly been used to its limits, like It’s flat and doesn’t even form a suction like I would expect it to. The guy has heard me flush twice and that hasn’t calmed him down, he’s still huffing out there. at this point I’ve exhausted all my resources, it won’t unplug and I’ve unplugged many toilets in my life. This guy IS NOT leaving and I can’t stay in there all day so eventually I say fuck it, shit happens man sometimes you gotta ask for another plunger. I planned on explaining my situation to the staff and asking if they had a plunger I could borrow. . I put my jacket on, open the stall door and look at that man who’s been making my poop uncomfortable for the past 5 minutes. This guy was clearly annoyed but I wasn’t about to let him walk into a flooded toilet, I told him “I’m going to have to ask for some help, that’s flooded pretty good” instantly this man replies “for FUCK sake!” Then storms out of the bathroom… well that was awkward as fuck. THEN another man comes out the urinal stall, smiles at me and leaves (doesn’t wash his hands lol). I Leave the bathroom after washing my hands, look around, I don’t see the angry man so I tell my girlfriend, we need to go. Like I’m sorry, yeah I flooded the toilet but there was no poop or anything gross, I was definitely feeling hella embarrassed. I’m not one to get embarrassed in extremely awkward situations, in fact I thrive in them. My girlfriend often gets upset at me for making situations in public awkward but this time, nope I couldn’t do it. . We get to the car and hightail it out of the country. . Once on the road I tell the mrs about my awkward situation and we had a good laugh at my expense. Looking back if I were the guy in the urinal stall I’d be laughing my ass off. To the other guy, I’m sorry man but shit happens, you turned it into a big scene. a 5 minute walk across the parking lot and there was another toilet so not necessary the end of the work.  but I definitely inconvenienced the hell of that guy and for that I’m sorry lol . . TL;DR while on a road trip, we stopped to use the bathroom and get a coffee. While using the bathroom, I clogged the only toilet which lead to one of the most awkward situations in my life."

The toilet paper dispenser was on the opposite wall, and it was empty, with another roll sitting on top. I had to stretch for it, and as Im leaning over to stretch farther (why is this thing so far away?) The toilet broke loose from the floor and fell over. Luckily I had flushed once already, but the tank broke and flooded the bathroom. I was soaked and still had to wipe. Lol that was an awkward walk back to my car."""

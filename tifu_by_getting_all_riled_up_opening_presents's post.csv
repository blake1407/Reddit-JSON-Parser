I (30 M) am like a child when it comes to opening presents. The more violent I can unwrap the gift, the better. Its like a competition to have the most absurd amount of wrapping paper bits possible and actually quite the opposite of how to efficiently open any box. But its fun, so I keep doing it. :-). Im used to going to my home country to spend Christmas with my family. This year though, I have a new girlfriend and she is working between Christmas and New Year, so she couldnt join. Therefore we decided to do a pre-Christmas dinner (Christmas Eve Eve), so we could eat together and open each others gifts. The dinner went really well, having - as always at this time of the year - eaten way too much. Now comes the FU: I started opening the gift that I received from my sister and my girlfriend noticed my - very - childishness at opening up the present. Successfully done so, I proceeded to grab the present my girlfriend bought for me and started doing the same.  only now.  it slipped my hands.  and.  broke on the floor.  still in the box.  I was unwrapping  . My girlfriend, seeing the display, started laughing, while I myself was very shamefully now unboxing a broken vase, which was very lovingly engraved with our nicknames for each other. Apparently my girlfriends family members have a tendency to break presents on first use. Needless to say I am at the top of that list now having broken my present before it even exited the box it came in  . I am never living this down  . TLDR: Broke the engraved vase my girlfriend bought for me as a Christmas present while unwrapping it. I am now at the top of the list of her familys first time use present breaker list."

I was thinking about going to somebody working with glass, to ask if they can cut the broken side evenly, so nobody cuts himself when grabbing the vase. I would love to do something like what you suggested; but I honestly have no talent for arts and crafts, so it would end up worse than broken."""

Just slow down and ask if anything is breakable before you start next time. We needed dishes but realized how expensive they were so husband decided we’d start using the wedding China for everyday use at the lake cabin!!  Once I got past the idea it became fun because we’d used them twice in 30 years and kids didnt want them due to it meaning nothing. Now we have used them so much (hot dogs, etc) that the joke is the first person in family to break one has to glue it back together and it will be displayed on the wall. They now are a part of a fun memory my kids(20’s) do all they can to be careful not wanting to be the one to break. LoL. We just laughed when my mom almost broke one banging a spoon on it without knowing everyone had eyes on her just waiting. !gif(emote|freeemotespack|scream)"""

tifu,Epicgaminglmao,t2_feij8da0,t3_18scsn1,,12/27/23 17:13,0,0,0.37,21,"""TIFU by getting expelled from my Catholic school.. I (16m) go to a highly Catholic school in California. One day, I pissed off one of my bullies (also 16m). I don  know how the fuck he even got into this school, considering its a Catholic school with strict bullying rules, but here we are. I apparently took ""his"" food at lunch (I got the last batch of french fries) and he was so mad that he got with my crush. So I, as the esteemed gentleman I am, I got with his best friend and made his best friend leave him. Now, you see, the issue with that, his best friend is a man. I am a man. We go to a Catholic school. Do you see where I am going with this? Once the school learned of our ""relationship"" we got expelled for being ""subhuman homos"". Anyway, its been 6 years now, we have 2 adopted children, we are getting married next year and we have a pet dog named Barkley. . TL;DR - I got kicked out of my Catholic school for getting into a gay relationship with my bullys best friend."

For comparison, a couple of gay friends spent three years adopting a child who was already in their foster custody, and theyre already both employed and have stable housing. If that had read ”15 years later. "" I would have believed you."""

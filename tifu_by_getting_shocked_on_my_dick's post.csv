tifu,legends94,t2_3plh181s,t3_18spyff,,12/28/23 04:28,0,53,0.76,29,"""TIFU by getting shocked on my dick. Disclaimer. This just happened literally within the hour of me posting this. . Let me start by saying that I installed an LED Strip light in my room from Amazon. Nothing expensive and it came with a weird power supply. The power supply has multiple barrel connector outputs that I just let hang down figuring they wouldn’t be harmful just laying around. . Fast forward 2 days and I’m laying in my bed, watching a movie with a fwb over FaceTime. After the movies over she hangs up because she’s going to sleep but then texts back saying she’s in the mood for some fun and asks if I can send her a video of me finishing the job because she misses me. Who am I to disappoint? So I start my usual ritual and whip out my phone to record the last few moments for her. For some reason I decided to use my built in iPhone camera to catch everything in 4K 60 FPS HDR glory. I finish and record the whole thing but noticed a bright flash as I was in the final stages of the process. . I go through the video in super slow motion before I send it over and there it is. I tiny bolt of electricity going towards and hitting the tip of my meat. So fast that if you blink you’d miss it and I didn’t feel a thing. . I’m not sure if I need to call a physician or an electrician. Needless to say she got a good kick out of it and she thinks she’ll get super powers the next time we have sex. . Edit: I think the wacky power supply for the LED lights might’ve charged up the furniture in my room somehow and possibly charged me up. I’m not sure if that’s how electricity works though. . Update: FWB is an RN. She doesn’t seem concerned and has started calling me “Thor”. Guess no harm no foul lol. . TL;DR: I got zapped on my dong while beating it."

tifu,Henderson2026,t284ba0tjf,t1kf9hqmp,t318spyff,12/28/23 08:26,0,7,0,0,"""Me and a friend of mine were at friend of his house one night late. Weve been drinking beer all day and in to the night so it was all a little bit buzzed and you know when you drink beer drink one and piss two. Now this is out in the country so taking the whizz off the back porch during the daytime would have been a normal thing but at night in the dark he didnt see the electric fence about a foot behind the porch. Let us just say that urine on is a great electrical conductor. I dont think Ive ever heard anyone screams so loud and all my life. On a side note the brand name of the fence charger was called the weed chopper because if a blade of grass or small weed touched it it would actually burn it in two so you know its one of the higher powered units."""

tifu,TooStrangeForWeird,t2gnnjiqxxo,t1kfbxoyd,t1kfbf9l0,,0,1,0,0,"""Yup. Same reason you can touch a car battery. For real, you can just pick it up and move it or grab both terminals with your bare hands. Theyre only 12V. Even though they can throw out like 100A, the 12V cant penetrate skin. If youre jumping a car or whatever, the sparks are because 12V is plenty to go across metal. But you can stand there and hold the other end of the cable no problem. . You wouldnt want to touch house wiring though, 120v will go right through you. 240v (for large electric appliances) will fry your ass lol."""

tifu,TooStrangeForWeird,t2gnnjiqxxo,t1kfarbvm,t1kfanwf5,12/28/23 13:23,2,6,0,1,"""I was thinking the same thing. Theyre usually 5-12 volts tops, it cant do anything. You can just touch it freely. When splicing 12v wires I often do it live to make sure I have a good connection."""

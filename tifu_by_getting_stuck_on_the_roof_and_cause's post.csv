Let me start with that we had a small leakage a while a go in the kitchen which had been restored. There was a pipe leaking. The pipe was a bit rusty. After taking out the pipe, I noticed that the previous owners clogged the pipe and it was completely useless. I thought it would disperse the heat from the over, but unfortunately not. So the pipe was taken out and a layer (roofing felt?) was being burned on it (no idea how to proper explaining it due to English not being my native tongue). . I was in the kitchen and heard some drips falling on the ceiling. I first checked it out on the attic/space above the kitchen. I noticed it came from the chimney, which is not being used anymore. . I decided to get on the roof with a ladder to check if perhaps I can do something about it immediately or if I can see the problem. I was not even 2 minutes on the roof, and noticed I would not be able to do something about it right away, and could not even see what the possible problem could be. So I wanted to climb down the ladder again, but right when I walked back to the ladder, a small drift of wind blew my ladder on the ground and left me on the roof. While the ladder started to fall, I walked towards the ladder right on top of the new layer of roofing felt, and I unfortunately punctured it. So now I was stuck on the roof with a new freaking hole on it. I called a friend of mine to come over and also try to fix this hole that I just created immediately. So within an hour it was all fixed, except for the chimney. . TL;DR I heard something dripping inn the kitchen and checked out the roof to see what it could be, and I got stuck on the roof with an extra hole on the roof"

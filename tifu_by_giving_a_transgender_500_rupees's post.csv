It is common for people in India to give transgenders to ask for money and common for people for people to give small sums of money as it has something to do with Hindu mythology. I have seen my father do this on multiple occasions where he gives trans people 10-100 rupees upon asking. I was at the beach with a friend who had come to visit me from another state and a transgender approached us for some money. I took out my wallet to give them a 100 rupee note which they took and then they forced me to open my wallet and took 4x500 rupees notes out of it and said something. I then in an agressive tone asked them to return the money and she gave me back all the money but at the end of the day I was left with no money in my wallet and I dont think I had spent enough throughout the day to finish everything which makes me think if they used some slight of hands to take one of the 500 rupee note. And I have been overthinking about this quite a lot and cant help myself. Can some of you please confirm that its ok if they took that 500 and it wasnt my fault. Please. . TL;DR: I gave a transgender person 500 rupees in India, following a common cultural practice, but they took 4x500 rupee notes from my wallet. After a confrontation, they returned the money, but I suspect they might have kept one note, leaving me worried and overthinking the situation."

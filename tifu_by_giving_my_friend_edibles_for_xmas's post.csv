tifu,cowsandwhatnot,t2_l5hlm,t3_18si5at,,12/27/23 21:05,0,433,0.93,33,"""TIFU by giving my friend edibles for xmas. Technically my friend had the FU but I was the one gifting cookies so . For a few years my partner and I have been baking gingerbread cookie edibles for everyone in our friend group. It started out one year when we didn  have a lot of cash and an acquantaince had gifted us a bunch of sub-par pot theyd grown. The cookies were a huge hit and the cookies are now expected by friends and family every holiday season. This year a new friend (old coworker) entered into the fray, and i was feeling full of holiday spirit. I saw my friend and mentioned I had a Christmas present for her, and would stop by later to drop it off. When I got to my friends house, her dad answered the door. Now, her parents are pushing 70, and are the sort of ultra conservative christian couple that could go in a cheap made-for-TV movie about strict uptight parents. I made awkward small talk with the dad until my friend got to the door, at which point I was invited in to hang out with the family. My friend intervened and tried to shuffle her parents off, but they were both just sort of hovering around as we stood by the door. I gave my friend the cookies, told her theyre best after you microwave them for 15 seconds, and high-tailed it out of the house. . Now, I had mentioned before that I make christmas edibles- and Id sent my friend a text before and after I made the drop reiterating that theyre not regular cookies- but this didn  translate and I received a message from her telling me each parent at a whole cookie. Mind you, most seasoned cookie monsters eat a half cookie tops and theyre good for a few hours, so mom and dad are about to be Cheech and and Chong. My friend calls me in a panic asking what will happen to her parents, and I can hear them in the background asking ""how many grams are in the cookies?"". After a few minutes I convinced them that theyll be fine, to put on a movie and order a pizza, and we ended the call. Honestly can  believe this just happened to me, it feels like a movie!! . tl;dr: gave my friend edibles for christmas and her ultra conservative christian parents ate them by mistake."

Panic attacks, shivers, hallucinations, sweating and nausea. As someone who knows what youre doing such a hard/bad trip can be overcome without damages but I think a non-user and especially a conservative-anti-drug person would be absolutely TRAUMATIZED if confronted with a potent dosage. Such things can change lives and is definitely a major FU"""

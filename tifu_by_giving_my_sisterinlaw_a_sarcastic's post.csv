I have been told by my friend that the jokes I make through text always get the wrong reaction and out of context would come out as crass. So I’m moving to a new place with my family and my brother tasked me to clean up the house. I spent about two hours vacuuming the living room, dining area, dry kitchen, office room and even the ceiling(Cobwebs are hard to get rid off when you don’t have an extension cord) and took a break before going to the second floor. I checked my phone and got a text from my S-I-L, Rose (not real name) and she told me to feed the cats both downstairs and upstairs(She was taking care of a relative’s cat.  and kept it in her room). So I though of being silly and responded:.  “I spent 2 hours vacuuming the first floor and the ceiling. Anything else you want to put on my plate?”. And yes readers, I too want to punch my own face after rereading that. I checked back on my phone after a while and I was sent a paragraph from Rose tearing me a new one. . Her response:. “So? Isnt that what I do almost everyday? Did I every complain anything? And Im just asking you help to put the cat food for me and thats too much? If its too tired for you to do that then fine, dont need. And just for your fucking information, Ive been cleaning up in the new house too. Youre not the only fucking one that doing house chores wtf. Think before you speak.”. I have never folded and responded as fast as I did the moment I finished reading that. Now, Rose is not usually this volatile with her responses. She is very kind and likes to joke around, only getting mad when it is necessary. I have made her annoyed a few times before and also got her mad once by raising my voice out of anger at my niece(Yes, I am a pos for doing that and I regretted it ever since) So getting this response from Rose threw me off and made me go damage control. I apologised to her through text after that and she forgave me, not without telling me that the joke I did should have had emojis to make it come out as a joke(I don’t use emojis, so all my text a read like their my genuine way of speaking). Rose apologised in return for swearing at me in her response. That is a huge lesson learnt by an idiotic me. . TL;DR: S-I-L asked me to feed the cats. I responded sarcastically about cleaning the house. She got mad, I hastily apologised, we made up and lessons were learn."

Anw you sound like a generally balanced person who is just in the throes of growing up / learning what to say what not to say. From what you’ve shared I’m sure you’ll be an excellent human with the love and support that your family has for you. All the best my friend :)"""

They also make the big bulbous brushes with extendable handles that you can use to get them down but then you have to use your hand to clean the brush off.

So I dont think the issue here is the lack of emojis or the inability to convey sarcasm through text. . I think you need to reevaluate why you feel the need to make jokes like that to begin with."""
tifu,deleted,,,t318thkro,,0,1,0,1,"""I usually joke around like this too but we need to understand that the other person may not always be in the mood to take a joke due to any reason whatsoever so when someone comes and jokes, it just pushes them to their edge and they lash out (sometimes rightfully too)"""

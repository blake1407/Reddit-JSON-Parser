tifu,Abnormal_Chemicals,t2_k76oyesy,t3_18sl403,,12/27/23 23:34,0,0,0.46,41,"""TIFU by greening out on a first date. So the title explains it all but to add a few more details, I f19 had been talking to another girl f19 for a few months now and we decided to go on a date because I was finally in her area (met on tinder while I was home for thanksgiving break) we agreed to take 1/2 an edible each that she brought and it all went downhill after that. Not sure what strain it was or how much thc was in it but I don’t remember 80% of the ultimately 1:30 long date, I’m pretty embarrassed now that I’m more sober and can realize it, I’m also fairly sure I’ll end up on one of those tinder nightmares subreddits. I plan on messaging her in the morning and apologizing and explaining I’m not usually like that. . Tl;dr I accidentally took too much of an edible on a first date and now I’m super embarrassed. ETA can you guys please help me write out an apology text for me to send this morning? I don’t know where to start "

Just tell her you were really affected by the edible. Simple. Most adult solution. . Also, you basically have 10 years to go wild and fuck your life up.

Weed is somewhat normalised but its totally a psychedelic. Your brain continues its development until about 25 years old, give or take. Theres no hard threshold but I wouldnt F with it until a few years into the 20s. At most, a lil puff once a year or so until then. Edibles would absolutely be off the table. Some links:. - how the brain develops and its susceptibility to damage by age groups (first chart): . - a more casual article: . For the record, I love psychedelics. Theyre sacred tools rooted at the centre of every civilization in history. They can help us immensely but they need to be treated with respect and caution. Please take them responsibly. As for your date, be honest about what your intentions with her were (to go wild?) and that youd like to try again more soberly if shes up for it. Good luck."""

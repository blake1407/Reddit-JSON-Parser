Today we were playing and I had him on my lap on the couch and he jumped out of my lap out of nowhere. He yelped a few times and ran away from me. . I checked him over and hes absolutely fine but I am absolutely heart broken and so upset that I hurt my baby. I love him so much and I hate seeing him sad or hurt. I recently posted to r/AITA and r/Puppy because Im new to being a puppy parent and I was looking for advice. I feel like everything I do is hurting him and I love him so much it hurts. Im still crying while writing this while he is chewing on a ball next to me on the floor. . TL;DR my puppy jumped out of my lap and yelped from fright and I broke down crying from guilt and fear"

I was so worried I was about to make a vet appointment because I was scared he was hurt but was pretending he was fine. Hes playing and he devoured his dinner like normal and his tail is always going waaay over the speed limit so Im not noticing any odd behaviour but Im keeping an eye on him a little closer now"""

Think of any time someone has accidentally hurt you and you’ve had to verbalise that it hurt. That’s what our pets do when they yelp or let out a cry. . And especially when pets are that young they’ll do dumb things, accidentally get hurt, etc because they don’t know any better. Kids are the same. You’re doing great and the fact you care so much is wonderful. Don’t beat yourself up. Just give your pup a lot of love"""

tifu,misterjive,t2ul2t4bos,t1kfhngzq,t318tu14e,12/29/23 19:39,0,3,0,0,"""It could be something as simple as he went to move his leg, a claw caught in your pants, and it pulled on his toe and he didnt like it. If hes not showing signs of injury and hes back to his happy self hes probably already forgotten about it. But good on you for giving a shit. :)"""

But if your puppy is acting normal and doesnt seem to be sore anywhere then there shouldnt be anything to worry about. . This guy will soon be 4 years old and hes an odd one.  he has yelped once and it was because he got spooked. Weve accidentally stepped on his tail a few times and he has a penchant for bashing his head against the underside of tables, and he just stays quiet and his own happy self. Dont feel too bad about pupper jumping off your lap on to the floor, hopefully theyll learn not to do that again."""

Then suddenly he flipped himself over and I wasnt expecting it and he fell onto the ground. Its only a foot drop but he still let out a few yelps and ran away. I went after him and checked him over and then cried into his fur for an hour out of guilt while he played with my hair."""

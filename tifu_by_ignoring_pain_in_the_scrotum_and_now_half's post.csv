Im a overweight man and I sleep on my side most of the time, and it messes with my ballsack sometimes, over the years Ive learned to just ignore it and keep my little buddies warm cupped in my hands sometimes when I sleep, but it sometimes happens that they got crushed or rather swollen, it was hurting a lot always but it went away after a few days ! Me being the no doctor idiot I am( I have seen the light from this experience) I just ignored it when it happened 2 days ago. . But this time the pain was much worse, in fact it was so bad that I couldnt even stand up straight after day one.  Fast forward to me going to the doctor the next day only for him to telle that they cant save my right testicle, great right? Just because I didnt immediately go, in fact if you guys twist your testicles (the twisted one feels hard, sharp yet dull pain very immense when you touch!) . Please go immediately because it can die off in 4-10 hours in most cases  . Anyways Im laying here with some tube coming out of where my balls are(god damn I gotta get used to saying ball without the S now ) or something and I really fucking learned my lesson on immediately going to the doctors the next time.  Today was not a nice day. Happy Hollidays & a happy new year guys. TL;DR. I ignored pain in my balls for two days cause I thought it would get better on its own and lost my right nutt because of it"

The volume of my scrotum is obviously reduced by roughly half, and drapes a bit askew.  Such that if anyone is to ask me ""hows it hangin,"" I can legitimately state ""a bit to the right."". I also ride motorcycles (I currently have 3) and I think having less to deal with there is actually of slight benefit. I did ask my dad about that, since he had experience doing so with both and as a monorchid (as we are properly referred to), and he concurred that it was more comfortable to ride with only 1.  So less is more apparently. I actually have a rather high libido and when my wife (of 25 years so far) & I got together, when I was 18 and she was 35 (cougar), we were going at it like rabbits. Legit 3 to 5 times per day for a while.  So much that I was actually hospitalized for 3 weeks due to a brain chemistry imbalance because I was not eating or sleeping enough. TBH, I kind of wonder whether losing 1 may have been a good thing to reduce my testosterone.  Perhaps having both would have made me some kind of ravenous monster willing to go beyond what is acceptable (IFYKWIM). Ive not been tested for my testosterone level or sperm count, but I do suspect that the volume of my ejaculate is likely reduced from what it would be if I were firing double-barreled. My wife & I were never able to have children together, though she did have 1 from her first marriage, but there were complications and she also has subsequent issues in that department as a result. We talked about maybe adopting, but it wasn  a big deal and I enjoy having more money to live well and buy myself & my wife pretty much whatever we want. Im also somewhat hairy all over and presently have a very full beard. I do seem to have slightly thicker hair on the left side of my body. Not sure if theres a correlation."""

It had swollen up to the size of a baseball and I stayed home from school. I was too embarrassed to tell my mom why. The swelling reduced and I thought I was in the clear, but by the next morning it had swelled again to the size of a softball and I couldnt bear the pain, so I told my mom who took me to the ER. It was too far gone. When they were in there surgically removing it, they secured my remaining testicle to the inside of the scrotum with 3 triangulated sutures since, apparently, men who have 1 torsion tend to have another. They offered me a prosthetic edit: testicle implant, but I declined. I havent had any issues of that nature since. Many years later, in an ironic twist of fate, my father was riding his motorcycle in the mountains around a blind right curve when another motorcyclist going the opposite direction, cutting the curve, hit my dad head-on.

I went directly. GP Said it was a ""slow"" torsion. went to hospital. checked, said there was no such thing as a ""slow"" torsion and send me home with some pain killers. Two weeks later and the pain goes straight through the pain killers and with (by now) a grapefruit in my pants to the hospital. Well well look who was right.  (thank god for the morfine injection tough) While being angry for.  ""it could have been saved you numbnuts"" I get the option of directly removing it or ,their words, letting it shrivel up an die.

They will never admit anything and with a lot of luck and the evidence you only get a ""yeah woops, happends, good luck with it"" out of it. Anyway, part 2. like mentioned in other comments the other 1 needs to be ""set in place"" so that can  torsion as well. Been straight up lied to. I got the option to be under anesthesia or just have a local injection. I hate nausea, which is linked to being ""fully away/sleep"", so I ask well WHERE goes the needle with the local injection, hehehe.  /scary mental images. ""oh, no, the injection is in the upper thigh"". so I chose the local Injection.

I didn  plan on writing this all, but.  a blown up ball is painfull and not nice. Complete incompetence and being lied to multiple times  it triggers easily when you come across this subject . Edit: little text box on mobile phone browser doesn  improve my already questionable writing skills. Edit 2: part 2 was a few months later. So not a single bit of morfine or pain killers in me when the needle went inside the jingle ball. Fun fact: The injection worked and there was no pain during the ""sewing"", but you do feel the thread go through. FYI: they get a needle and thread and they sew it to the ""holder"" on 3 places. The idea is that the Scar tissue fuses then together on those 3 spots making it attached. So again: Go ASAP and if you have a choice, let them do it while under anesthetic."""

I wouldn’t wish that kind of pain on my worst enemy. That being said - Idk if your doctor mentioned it, but since one has twisted there’s a chance the other could do it at some point in the future. Keep a close eye on it. It seems to happen more often to us guys with extra loose/flexible ligaments.  The preventative fix is to have the remaining ball/epididymis “anchored” in place so it doesn’t have enough room to twist again.  The downside is it won’t move freely up and down as much as it naturally would. If you were referred to a urologist I’d ask them about performing the surgery for some added peace of mind.  My urologist didn’t do both sides - only the one side that had twisted - and I wish I would’ve made him do both."""

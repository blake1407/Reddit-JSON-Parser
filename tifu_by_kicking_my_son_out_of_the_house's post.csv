TL;DR: I fucked up by getting aggressive with my son and kicking him out after I caught him kissing another boy, And I feel awful about it. A bit of a serious TIFU, but please learn from my mistake.  I (39M) have three children, my son being the eldest of the three having recently turned 17. His sisters are 13 and 9. My ex wife (36F) and I got divorced about two years ago, and my son had been living with me while his sisters live with their mom and her new partner. We were younger than we wouldve liked when we had our son, and have definitely learned a lot by raising him. The divorce was messy to say the least and it definitely affected my behaviour and especially my temper, small things have really been setting me off these past two years and my son was often caught in the crossfire. He started acting out by talking back to me and smoking and our relationship started to deteriorate a bit, especially over the past year. This is where I fucked up, I usually work long hours and dont get home until about 9pm, but two days ago I left work a couple hours earlier. When I pulled up I caught my son and his supposed best friend making out in the driveway. His best friend is another boy.  I was so caught off guard that I let my emotions take over and I started yelling at them, and told his friend to leave while I took my son inside to talk to him. Now, I didnt think he was actually gay which was my first mistake. For some reason my mind immediately went to all the other ways he acted out lately and I figured that he must just be doing this to get some sort of rise out of me like he usually does with the smoking or the backtalk, stupid I know. I didnt hear him out, it was more of a blind rage I felt and I said and did some things I really regret and have never done before. He stormed off to his room and I followed him and made him pack a bag and told him to get the hell out. After hearing myself say those words I was immediately regretted them but the damage was already done and my son stormed out of the house entirely. . This was around 10:30 pm.  Now that my son is gone and ive had some time to calmly think things over I dont even know why I cared. Im not a homophobic person and deep down I mightve suspected he was gay, but for some reason seeing it like this just sent my emotions into overdrive. I got a text from my ex wife around 1am cussing me out and letting me know he went to their house and is gonna be staying there for a while. My son has not yet returned any of my texts, and I dont know how to fix our relationship but I hope this is something we can come back from. Let this be a lessen to all parents who might see this. Take a step back and be nicer to your kids than I was."

Homophobia is not a  hing you have or dont have"". Its the collective mindset you carry from nurturing and taking as truth a whole bunch of toxic beliefs and attitudes readily avilable in most cultures, and doing nothing in your own mind to think critically about them. Its something you do as a person because of your own reluctance or laziness to perceive other people in ways that are actually respectful and caring, accepting instead notions that actively harm other people. This is what guided your actions. Nothing else. Take responsibility for it. . Im really sorry about what happened with your son. You need to fix it and stop making it about your own feelings. You absolutely should ""feel awful about it"". What you really need to be doing is finding out, specifically from him , how your betrayal has harmed him. By asking him, and by also asking him what you can do to fix it and make it up to him. Then doing it. And continuing to do it in perpetuity to show him you have actually done the work to be a better person and want to demonstrate that to him. . And you do that by being the best gay-son ever dad in the universe and proving to him that his happiness matters to YOU more than anything in the world, and it always will."""

Would you rather have a gay son or a dead (still gay) son?. You might have destroyed his life. You probably destroyed any relationship you have had with him. You have shown him that your love for him is contingent on your approval of his dating life. You have utterly failed as a parent. If he never wants to see or speak with you again you’ll probably blame him, but that blame belongs on your shoulders, not his. Until you realize just how deeply you have harmed him, you’re not worthy of his forgiveness."""

Im pained watching this thread immediately get judgmental and do to you what you regret doing to your son. Do you deserve to feel bad? Yeah. People that don  feel bad dint don  change. Is their verbal abuse helping ANYBODY? No. . People that hit their boiling point often say and do things that aren  in their actual values. Rules and esteem are in that part of our brain that shuts down when we panic. The people in crisis I take care of say racist and homophobic things and then feel extremely guilty when they settle down. When in crisis and upset, they say the worst thing they can think of that would shock others, so often things they think NOBODY should say or do come out. Its called ""scripted language"" and is usually a precursor to physical aggression. You had an epic freak out. This happens to a lot of people with trauma, so its more common than you think. Lets focus on whats important here: your son. . Your son is hurt. Not just by this, but lots of things. If he thinks you don  accept him or love him, it comes from more than this singular event. He has likely seen you lose your shit before. You have some clarity and self awareness about whats wrong, but don  just tell on yourself-- make a change. . The best (if not only) thing that is absolutely necessary to do is to address these problems youve identified. Not that you messed up,  but that YOU are hurting and it makes you less than the father you wish to be. Your son is hurt, and he has a right to be guarded around you or avoid you until he feels safe around you. Until he sees you making changes and taking care of yourself. Hurt people will hurt people. As his father, it wouldve been important to him to have you model taking care of yourself during the divorce. Can  go back in time, so start now. Your apologies and regrets mean nothing if people don  see you taking action to prevent yourself from doing it again, because saying ""I just won  lose control of myself again"" has never worked for any of us. Im not saying you ""should"" get counseling (I mean,  yeah,  you should, but how/why you go about it will make a difference). You deserve to feel okay and you clearly haven  for a long time. By neglecting yourself,  you neglected your sons well being and it snowballed into this. Use every resource you can get your hands on. If you get a shitty counselor that isn  helping (it happens), get a new one. Attend groups, achieve work/life balance, spend time with other parents, get through YOUR  shit. You just warned everyone in this post that if you don  deal with your demons, that youll pass them onto your kids. . So stop just saying ""I fucked up"" and ""Im sorry."" Tell your son, tell your ex, tell YOURSELF that everything is going on pause so you can work on yourself to ensure you are able to offer your best and be a positive safe adult to your son. You ruptured, yes, but now is the time to focus on repair. Respect your sons desire to have distance. Allowing him to say no to you makes it possible for him to say yes someday. Whether he comes around or not, you won  have wasted anything bettering yourself. You weren  safe for him, so if you love him,  you won  force it. Youll invite him to decide if youve done enough to FEEL safe with you. Im emphasize ""feel"" because actual safety versus felt safety are different. Even if he believes your apology and comes home right away,  none of what I said changes: a better life awaits both of you if you start taking steps to heal."""

If you talk to him and explain what you just did in this post, tell him about having a rough two years and that its been very hard since the divorce and thats made you very on edge. Reassure him that you made a gigantic mistake and do it with a very serious tone of remorse. . Tell him that it under no circumstances is okay to let your anger and your temper out on your son, and that you are truly sorry that you did, and you got stuck in a rage and it made you not see clearly. The fact that you are retrospecting your own behaviour right now and finding the right answers means you are on the right path. A truly homophonic person would never have that hindsight. . Parents are never perfect and we must remember that they have feelings, stress and rough times just like kids do. . Tell him you love him and all that matters to you is him being happy. Good luck.

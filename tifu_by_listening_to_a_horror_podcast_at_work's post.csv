The week before Thanksgiving I was at work where I primarily edit video content for a large international brand. While editing Ill also listen to a horror podcast in the background some days since sometimes the editing is just looking for specific footage. . While I was editing away one of the stories on the podcast made me feel particularly nauseous given how graphic the accident they were talking about was. I thought I might throw up so I made my way to the bathroom in case I did, but when I got there I didn  throw up. Instead, I woke up looking at the ceiling laying flat on my back in the middle of the bathroom. I slowly got up, felt the back of my head to see how bad the damage was and had a big gash on the back of my head. After cleaning up a small bit of blood on the floor and heading back over to my desk I asked one of my coworkers to take a look at the back of my head to decide if it was an ER visit worthy cut. Turns out the clasp on the back of my ball cap had sliced a good 1"" to 1.5"" gash into the back of my nogin. So my coworker took me to the ER where I received 7 staples and everyone got a good laugh out of my silly story. TL;DR. I passed out after listening to a scary podcast at work and had to get 7 staples in my head."

Next minute I woke up slumped onto the lady next to me. Book, bag, and phone dropped to the floor, and everyone nearby looking at me with concern. I didn’t hurt myself but it was embarrassing AF"""

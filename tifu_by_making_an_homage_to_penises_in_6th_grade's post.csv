I (26m) was in 6th grade, around 11 or 12, learning about the color wheel in art class. The assignment was to cut out a shape on a stack of construction paper, to make 8 or so identical objects, lay them out in a circle, and paint them in the colors of the color wheel. Other students cut out things like swords, or palm trees, since the paper we were given was shaped in a long rectangle, so it was easiest to cut out something long and thin. I decided that my shape was going to be a guy in a wizards hat. Alas, it wasn  far into my cutting out process that I realized my incredibly lacking art skills weren  exactly up to the task of cutting out the silhouette of a person on thick, uncooperative construction paper. And thus, I decided that the wizards arms would have to go. And then his shoulders. And his neck. And his head. But 11-year-old me knew how to save my masterpiece, by giving this featureless rectangle a prominent wizards hat on the end. Except, somewhere along the way, I ended up making the corners and tip of his hat more rounded than I had intended. In the end, I had somehow, completely by accident, ended up producing 8 identical silhouettes of a girthy, circumcised penis that day in art class. Not that I realized then, as a painfully naive little Catholic school boy. I went about painting each turgid, cardboard shlong with the utmost innocence, only mildly miffed that my ""wizard"" was lacking his arms. The art teacher either didn  notice, or wanted to spare me the embarrassment of calling attention to my fatal error, and allowed me to hang my abomination up in the hallway outside my classs homeroom along with all the other students. It wasn  until I was stood underneath that very monstrosity later that day, talking to a friend as we waited to enter sixth period, that he pointed out to me the unfortunate likeness my cutout had to male genitalia. To say I was mortified would be an understatement. After that last class, I whispered to my brother about the nature of my grievous error as he and I both waited at the open vestibule in the schools main hallway for the bus to arrive, drearily contemplating how I would fare being homeschooled for the rest of middle school, since there was no way I could ever set foot in this building again. What my brother did next is something I will always be grateful for. Without a word, he dashed down the hall, hanging a left towards the 6th grade classrooms, and returned a minute later with a square of crumpled blue construction paper in his fist. Into my hands he passed my abominable art project, which hed just valiantly ripped off the wall outside our classroom. I stuffed it into the lowest reaches of my backpack, to never again see the light of day, thanking my brother profusely all the while. None of the teachers ever mentioned anything about my art project being conspicuously missing, possibly because they were just as glad as I was that it was gone. Im so glad my brother went and tore that thing down, because otherwise I wouldve had to look at it every day for the next several weeks until we had another art project to replace it. As an end note, 10 years later I came out as gay, so maybe it was some kind of subconscious Freudian slip?. TL;DR: My abysmal art skills lead me to accidentally create a cutout of what looked like an erect penis in art class in middle school, and I only noticed when a friend pointed it out to me."

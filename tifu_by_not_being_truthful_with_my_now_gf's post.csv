tifu,CutToTheThrowAway,t2_1zlq9824,t3_18sokg4,,12/28/23 02:56,0,328,0.83,103,"""TIFU by not being truthful with my now GF initially and coming clean about it. As with most fuck-ups, the origins start long before today. . A year ago my (M21) first serious relationship officially ended. With it came all the heartbreak and trauma you’d expect from being cheated on and manipulated for months. I have never before been so hurt and swore off any relationship for the foreseeable future. My ex left me with a severe fear of abandonment, commitment and a need for sexual validation caused by some pretty hurtful things she did. . Fast forward five months, after lots of hooking up and casual sex as typical in a college town, I had done very little healing and just covered up my pain with sex. Until I met F. . She is the single most beautiful, kind, fun loving girl I’ve ever met. The second she introduced herself to me at the bar, I knew she was different. We went on a date and hooked up but it felt way more meaningful. I began to develop feelings for her and that terrified me. Those feelings heightened when she expressed the same back to me. With where I was at mentally, the fact we were about to be 8 hours long-distance over the summer and her own recent relationship trauma, we expressed our liking of each other but came to set terms of non-exclusivity. I assured her I was telling the truth about my inability to commit at the time and wasn’t just telling her that but let her know that she’s free to do whatever she wants over the summer. . Working as a bartender, I had plenty of opportunities to continue casually hooking up. At first, conflicted about what I wanted, I didn’t take these. I liked F after all. However, as I began to overthink, I felt as though refusing this was making me vulnerable to being hurt if I come back to school to her disinterested. To me at the time, that seemed like the exclusive commitment I was scared of. . So I had a casual hookup. Except this time it didn’t even give the temporary validation like before. It just made me more confused and like I wanted to commit even more. Which scared me. I shouldn’t have done it twice but I stupidly. did it again. After just feeling more conflicted, I stopped, realizing it wasn’t helping anything and just making my mental situation worse. . While we were both free to do what we’d wanted and discussed this, I didn’t feel right about it, especially since F and I were still texting and staying in contact. As scared as I was of committing, the idea of fucking it up with F seemed way worse. So when we got back to college and she asked about my summer, I told her I hadn’t pursued anyone. While I hadn’t pursued anything serious, I wasn’t telling the full truth. I wish I was strong enough to just tell her everything I’d done but decided I didn’t care to know what she’d done so I’d leave it behind me. . Some months pass and we’re hanging out a ton, I’m staying over at her house multiple times a week, we’ve gone on some amazing dates and most importantly, despite her past trauma, she managed to heal a lot of mine. She showed me so much affection, trust and patience while I slowly became more ready to officially make it exclusive with her. This entire time I was loyal to her and figured, as terrifying as it seemed, I was already basically her boyfriend and I didn’t want to risk not getting to be hers. . The months since then have been incredible. She’s been everything my ex wasn’t and despite how recent it all is, I truly do love her and wouldn’t do anything to hurt her. . We both went home for Christmas a few days ago and things were normal. However, drunk on Christmas Eve, she FaceTimed me and began talking. The conversation suddenly turned to her past trauma and her expressing that she’s felt distant to me lately because of an intense worry that I’m gonna hurt her in the future. Not only does this stem from her exes but also a very rocky relationship with her father and I gave her tons of reassurance and love as she deserves. She responded by telling me that she’s gonna ask me a question that I “have to answer 100% honestly.” I pinky promised her over the phone I would and she asked “did you do anything with anybody over the summer?” . I took a deep breath and knew, while it would likely hurt her a bit, I had to come clean. I confessed that I had two random hookups, explaining to her that I didn’t continue to contact them and that it was months before we became exclusive. . She lost it. . The hurt I saw on her face is the worst thing I’ve ever seen. She explained that she was loyal to me all summer and that she feels like she was in love with a lie. . I’ve tried to express to her how sorry I am, how much I regret it and how I was in a completely different headspace. I’ve assured her that’s nowhere near the person I am now and that I’m sorry I let my own trauma hurt her but done everything I can to prove that’s long behind me. . It completely destroyed her trust in me. I couldn’t sit there and lie to my girlfriends face but I didn’t know it would cause this. I should’ve never lied in the first place but I didn’t expect it to ruin our entire relationship. She wants to talk in person in a few days but she’s livid and I think she’s gonna end things. . I know I fucked up but I’m in a completely different spot now. Probably too late but I learned my extremely painful lesson. I’m terrified to lose her but I think I will. . TLDR; Met an amazing girl at a poor time when I was still healing over an ex. Overthought and decided to sleep with two girls. Didn’t tell her and told half truths about the summer. Girl became my girlfriend, came clean about it, she feels lied to and is probably done with me."

Its just that accusing OP of lying and gleefully saying that he reaped what he sowed isn  quite fair. He literally posted this to a sub saying he fd up!  Adding speculative accusations isn  useful here. (Also, the Friends comparison isn  fair either.  There its one character saying to another after a year that maybe they should take a break, only to find the ""break"" is one night.  and a one-night stand with someone else.  Its not a real agreement to see different people, like OP had, however ill-advised.)"""
tifu,candr22,t24v1xv,t1kfbxv0k,t1kfbh5k6,12/29/23 01:16,3,12,0,1,"""When it comes to relationships, Ive generally found that while you may be able to ""win"" in some strict reading of words exchanged, its not really relevant because were not robots and love/affection/intimacy/trust simply doesn  work that way. If youre familiar with Friends, this is basically the whole ""we were on a break"" situation. If youre unfamiliar, two characters are dating but they have some issues and go on a ""break"". They don  really define what that means exactly, and the guy ends up hooking up with someone else. He regrets it and comes clean but it causes a whole bunch of drama because the girl considered it cheating. Im probably messing up some details but the gist is there, and the point is that when it comes to romantic relationships, you can point to what may be very logical arguments all you want, but feelings aren  generally overpowered by logic and the prize for ""winning"" will most likely just be some smug satisfaction. and being alone. Also, OP may or may not have lied when this girl asked him about his Summer - we really don  know because presumably OP is paraphrasing to some extent. They may also be unintentionally misremembering minor details. You just can  read a post like this and take it was a literal transcript. The bottom line is that even if we assume that OP has recollected everything with 100% accuracy, its still not as simple as saying that they talked about not being exclusive. Both OP and the girl had recent relationship trauma and both are clearly still working through that. Regardless of what was said, OP recognized the possibility that hooking up with other people might hurt her, as they stated:. >While we were both free to do what we’d wanted and discussed this, I didn’t feel right about it, especially since F and I were still texting and staying in contact. but he went ahead anyway and despite being in regular contact, did not tell her. Both people involved here are probably not actually ready for a committed relationship, which is fine, and their combined error was in not communicating their true feelings about having other relationships. I think OP was dishonest with the girl, because it should be clear that she wanted to know whether he had been involved with other women and he chose to fixate on the specific language used in the question, rather than the intent. But I also think OPs love interest should have been more upfront and honest about her not wanting him to get involved with anyone else."""

Its unclear why she phrased it that way, but it may be the case that she only cared that there weren  any lingering flames out there, not whether or not he did something with someone else. Her saying that she was ""loyal to me all summer"" is kind of weird too; how can you be ""loyal"" to someone after telling him that you were okay not being exclusive?  I can  tell at all from the post what she really wanted and maybe neither could OP.  Its fair for her to be hurt, but not to condemn him for abiding by the rules they both agreed to.

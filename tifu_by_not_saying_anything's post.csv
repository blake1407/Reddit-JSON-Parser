Today, after coming home from work, I took the train for the last station back to my own station, therefore the train was almost empty at the beginning of the ride. When entering the station I noticed a pretty girl entering the station as well. The train was about to start, so I had to run up the stairs to get there in time. To my surprise, after entering the train, I saw the girl walking in the train right before departure. For some reason, she could have sat down anywhere, almost every seat was free, but she decided to sit down right next to me, and we kept smiling at each other and looking at each other. I am not the most extroverted person, so I just said nothing. . We both kept taking our phones out and looking at it for a few seconds before our eyes met again. All of a sudden, as if the ride only took 10 seconds, the train stopped at my station and while leaving the train, I was annoyed of myself for not even saying „hey“ or „hi“. Right before the train left the station, I looked back at her through the window from outside, and she was also looking at me. I regret it very much that I didn’t initiate any conversation. TLDR: I saw a pretty girl in my train, she may have been attracted to me as well, as we were smiling at each other, but I didn’t dare to talk to her, and regret it a lot in hindsight."

tifu,dave8271,t2xnmin,t1kfi439u,t1kfh0iev,12/29/23 21:35,1,3,0,0,"""Im happily married with a child now but man it still hurts when I think back to when I was younger and remember all the missed opportunities, particularly the ones where it only clicked years later that they were flirting with me. There were so, so many ridiculously hot women (I mean, not dozens, but enough for the fact Im very much average looking) in my twenties Im sure I could have slept with. And many of these werent even subtle, its just that I was too young, too dumb and most importantly too shy and in my shell to realise what they wanted at the time. Obvious with the wisdom and experience of greater age. Like no, your mates super hot ex who youd only met a handful of times and didnt really know that well didnt want to come over and share a bottle of wine that evening when you ran into her by chance four years after they broke up because she just wanted to chat and catch up over a movie u200d dear god that one stings the most."""

Very beautiful woman ahead of me in line was kind of looking at me, and I at her. I was formulating what to do, when she got her coffee. Then her girlfriend / partner met her (yes, they kissed) and then they left. I was relieved I had taken my time before I spoke up. Was a reminder that not everyone is straight hetero."""

She only appears once in a great while, and only when the train car is empty. Thank heaven you didn  try to engage her in conversation! Unable to speak herself, she wouldve sucked the soul out of your body through the words you would have uttered. Without intending to, without even being aware it was happening, you would have told her everything-- all about the disappointments of your childhood, the heartaches of your school days, all the disillusions you fostered during your years at college. By the time youd gotten to where you were describing your current bleak outlook, she would have sucked most of your soul into her own being, leaving you a nearly empty husk of a man, doomed to stay on the train forever, aimlessly bumping into other passengers while muttering, "" scuse me.  scuse me. "". But Lilitha, now energized, would continue her haunting, continue her reign as the Specter of The Train, hungry for the next poor devil who found her."""

tifu,BlinkerBeforeBrake,t2_80gg8,t3_18u951v,,12/30/23 01:34,0,2958,0.97,200,"""TIFU by putting my cat’s name on my Chewy account. Earlier this month, I got an email from Chewy saying my information couldn’t be verified. I figured it was something to do with changing my address so many times (we’ve moved apartments twice and just bought a house), so I decided to put it off until we were ready to move in. I make the call last week and figure everything is good to go. On Tuesday I notice things still haven’t moved forward, so I call again. Lady on the phone asks me to confirm my info, says it’s weird that the block is still happening and she can’t get around it. Tells me to try again in 24-48 hours. I gave it until Friday and went through the spiel. My name, confirm address, confirm email, confirm phone number. She can’t see why it’s blocked either and can’t get around it. “I’m going to bring this higher up. Just one more thing before I put you on hold, what’s the name on the account?”. “BlinkerBeforeBrake”. “No it’s not”. Oh no. It all clicks. “It might be under Debbie?”. “Yeah that’s what we have.”. “I think I know why my account isn’t accessible.”. Debbie is not a person. Debbie is a cat. My cat, who I order for on the account. And when I set it up two years ago, I thought it would be cute to have her name on the address label so it would be like she was getting mail. I didn’t realize I was claiming to be a maybe-real person named Debbie with my last name. It definitely looked like I was trying to steal someone’s identity. After lots of time talking to Chewy, the best they could tell me was to abandon the account and create a new one with my real information. I also need to re-upload her prescription for her IBS food, which I don’t have because we’ve moved so many times. And her old vet won’t be open until Tuesday because of the holiday. I ran out of food this week because I usually rely on autoship. The only safe thing to feed her until her food comes in is Gerber baby food, so guess I’m hitting the grocery store later. TL;DR - I put my cat’s name, Debbie, on her Chewy orders to be funny. Two years later Chewy can’t identify Debbie and permanently block the account. Now I have to wait until after the holidays to regain the prescription for her IBS food from her old vet, and give her (human) baby food in the meantime because it’s the only safe thing she can eat. EDIT: Thank you everyone for posting your kitties!! Loved opening up my phone today to see all the fellow voids and various minous. Have a happy new year!"

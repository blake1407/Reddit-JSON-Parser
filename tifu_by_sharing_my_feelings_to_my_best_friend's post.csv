tifu,Kisumake,t2_11llli,t3_18smna9,,12/28/23 00:58,0,336,0.78,125,"""TIFU by sharing my feelings to my best friend.. Yeah, Ive (34M) been in love with my (32F) best friend for the best part of a decade. Ive been her friend for 10 years now. It all started when I got dumped by my first ""real"" girlfriend. A seven years relationship going down the drain and I needed to flush it all out with a good alcohol wash. It was starting to be late, during a week night and the only person who was still up in my facebook friend list was her. She was a clerk at a convenience store near my place and we never really talked outside really. I took my chance, told her I really needed to get drunk this night and by chance, she also had a rough day and needed the stress relief. She wasn  even my type to begin with. A bit taller than me (Im kinda short, 57""), blonde, a bit too girly for me but hey, I was mainly there to forget and she seemed like someone I could have fun with. I was right. Super funny, interested in what I had to say, smart, both feet on the ground. The night went by super smoothly, we both went to her place and fell asleep cuddling each other. She even laughed the next day when I had to puke on the side of the road (she gave me a lift, I was waaay too drunk to drive). That was it. A good start to a nice friendship, but really though, it wasn  one. I didn  ask for this, nor did I planned to feel this way but man, she was like a sunshine shredding through my darkness. She made me feel whole when I needed it the most and the feelings I had for her started to crawl under my skin day by day. Back then, she was with some dork who didn  really loved her to begin with. She started to be closer and closer to me but still really loved him. There was a sexual tension between us sprouting more and more and Im ashamed to say this but I took the opportunity and went all out. This is my first F-Up. Sex was great, I can  deny that. Even the best I ever had to be frank. She matched my energy, what can I say?! But she still loved the other dude. and man was I falling hard for her after that. Weeks went by, then months, our little show still ongoing, until she decided to dump him. I was both relieved and stressed about the situation because I really didn  know how to approach her. She was hurt, needed me but at the same time she had to free herself from an abusive relationship and try to refocus on herself. And the only thing she did to do it was back then was to meet as much people as possible to forget him. My second F-Up was to stay there and say nothing. Ive let her talk about all of the man she met and fed without saying a god damn word. I should have just walked away, grieve and move on. but hey, love is blind. I finally overcomed my sadness by meeting a super sweet girl who was a bit older than me.  Super funny, had a strong heart and was super gorgeous. Like, that girl was my ideal type. Curly red hairs, freckles in her face, her collar bones and shoulders, a bit smaller than. She was a tomboy, was always wearing jean and was working as a welder. She even loved the same music as I did.  It was love at first sight. We immediatly clicked and got serious fairly quick. She knew about my best friend and my proximity with her and didn  mind. My third F-Up was to never set any boundaries with my friend during this relationship. She liked my new girlfriend but didn  like the attention I gave her. She had the sensation she lost the attention I had for her and multiplied it by tenfold for my new girlfriend. I brushed it away as mild jaelousy but I guess it was more than that. Man, Im not proud of all this. She started getting more and more flirty with me, a bit kinky when my girlfriend wasn  around and ultimately, you guessed it, I couldn  resist and did the unthinkable with her. Im pretty much certain my girlfriend knew at some point I cheated on her with my best friend because she one day dumped me out of the blue without any explanation. I was sad for a bit but I deserved it 100%. I thought I had my chances back with my friend, but hey, lets keep this a tradition, she found someone else not long after. At this point in my life, I got physically hurt. Injured myself while working, hitting my neck and my back badly and had to stop working for a good while (almost 8 years and counting now). I was still in love with my best friend but was too much a coward to tell her, yet again, because she had found someone new and I didn  want to lose her (my social circle went super small after my accident so I needed a win here). Ive kinda forget about being with her, even more when she married him a year after they started dating. But I couldn  move on. I was so stuck in this self-destructive loop of me being hurt badly, feeling unwanted, crippled and yet hoping for her to wake up and see how much I loved her that I practically stopped existing at this point. I was there for her when she needed help with her shop, when she felt bad about school or about her relationship and I was desperate for a bit of attention on my end. I mean, the sexual tension and proximity between us was still there but I didn  want to take a step this time. I didn  want to ruin a marriage, especially my best friend relationship. I dug a hole and went silent about it for years man. Im writting this up right now and I feel such like an idiot. Im sorry, this is dragging a bit here but you had to know the full extent of our ""friendship"" to understand why I F-Up for the last time, yesterday. She decided to end her marriage a couple months ago. Her husband was sick and didn  want to help himself. She tried as much as she could to help him out by finding solutions but nothing sticked. He was abusing meds and drinking to the point of being borderline violent. Thats when she decided it was enough. but hey, she loved the guy. Shes naive but still loved the guy. So I did my job as a friend and tried to support her as much as I could. Calming her anxiety, trying to cheer her up when she felt super sad. Shes now living a bit far from home and I can  drive so I have her moral support. She also always avoided coming to my place for more than 15 minutes (for the past 5 years), which I found weird AF and a bit rude. but I was also getting better myself. Ive lost weight, got back some of my confidence, got back a bit of a need for life, you know? 6 months later (now), shes feeling a bit better. She still said from time to time that she miss him but started to show interest in life again. She also started seeing people, just flings, for the sake of it. and to tease me back again. Thats when I started F-ing up again.  Man, Ive started complaining she never had a single second to come see me, not even when she was single again (for that part, its true. shes my bestfriend but she didn  even took the chance to take a coffee with me in 5 years) and that I was hurt about it. She told me she was still figuring out her life and that she did not have any spare time, not even for herself. Thats when everything went out. The whole story my friends, served on a platter for her to enjoy to its full extend. She went radio silent for a while until a couple days ago when everything went back like nothing happened. So yeah, yesterday, I decided I had enough and asked her what we were exactly. Last F-Up in this saga. I really didn  like the answer. She was confused because she had recently met someone she liked to the point of probably being exclusive to him for the time being. I couldn  I just couldn  anymore. Ive been suffering for the past 10 years and I had to add a coat on top of all this. I knew it was already going in this direction and I still stood there like an idiot. I had to do something. so I did what I could do best right now. I chosed myself. I thanked her for the good stuff that happened during the last decade (it wasn  all bad moments), told her I couldn  keep up with this anymore and that I wasn  angry nor disappointed. She had the right to live her life the way she wanted, with who she wanted and at the pace she wanted, but so did I. I wished her the best of luck and completely erased her from my life. It sucks. Really bad. Im hurt to the point of being on the verge to throw up because I know I can  get back from this. Something broke between us and Ive probably lost her forever. What other choice did I had?. &#x200B;. EDIT: I have to clarify certain things here before it gets out of hand. I was kinda overwhelmed when I wrote this TIFU since I have nobody to talk to currently and needed to vent out. Ive forgot to write certain key factors that need to be said. She knew I loved her back then and she also knew I had still strong feelings for her today.  When she dumped her first boyfriend 10 years ago, I tried to make a move and was met with a refusal. She wanted me, she just didn  want to commit herself in a serious relationship. I should have stopped there and move on but like I said, I was in love. I tried to get back in the game and flirt with other gals but it just didn  sticked with me.  Ive dialed back down on this part when she got married and stopped flirting with her until recently. Also, about the coffee part, its more complicated than this. Ive been inviting her to all sorts of events and party in the past 5 years (before and after covid mainly) and Ive always been greeted with excuses as to why she couldn  make it. Id be ok about the part where she was still married, since he could be a bit overwhelming to deal with, but after six months as a single person, going out and having fun with a bunch of other people, it kinda felt awkward for me, her best friend, to be left out each and every single time. Thats when I started getting a bit bummed about this while situation. Lastly, Ive told her about my ressurging emotions 2 weeks ago. I know she wanted to be free and just have fun with random dudes and at this point, Ive told myself ""Whats a couple more weeks over waiting 10 years to get a chance?"" The only thing Ive asked her was to give me a chance if she felt the need to have something more than casual with someone. It happened, not with me, I was fed up, I asked her the question that lead me here writting this post. And yeah, I also feel bad for the girl I was dating back then. Im really not sure if she knew about it but either way, I couldn  stay with her after that, no matter what. Tl;dr, I had to erase my best friend from my life because I was too much a coward to tell her how I felt about her for the past decade until it was already too late. &#x200B;"

I had lost my partner that I had recently gotten engaged to, that I never really told many people (including her) about and had just been and trying to get back into a normal life. We ended up getting hyper close for a couple of years talking every day and all that jazz.  She was between relationships and working on herself but would constantly invite me to go out on what was generally considered dates by many of our mutual friends despite neither of us admitting as much. These would be live music clubs to dance and vibe, fancy dinners, hole in the wall dinners, walking around the city at 2am cuz one of us couldnt sleep and called the other whod hop in a cab and wed just wander (wed both do it), go over to each others places and cook (though more her for me) and then just chill on the couch and sharing blankets and watching movies. After a few years of this, I straight up asked her if there was something between us because I felt kind of uncomfortable with both of us going out on dates with other people while we had such a close relationship.  At which point she pretty much said she didnt know what she wanted in a relationship and that she didnt really want to be in one with anyone.  It limped along for a few weeks with her getting more and more agitated that I was icing her out.  I ultimately said a few things I regret the phrasing of, but not the spirit of (if t hat makes sense) and that I was no longer willing to be a surrogate boyfriend and that she needed to either commit or let me go. We went our separate ways, and havent talked in 10 years.  And through mutual friends and just general social network updates, I learned that had we actually gotten together, despite having 2 fun years as a surrogate bf, that relationship would have been an absolute disaster with her being a completely different minded person than I had built her up to be in my head."""

The one before, it was exactly the contrary. I know she tried her best to stay with her ex-husband despite the problems he had but even she had to let it go at some point. It was becoming dangerous. What is bugging me is that she always felt safe, loved and appreciated while she was with me, at any time. I always made sure to brighten her day as much as I could because I didnt want to add another layer of sadness. She is not a bad person, not at all. I just think she took me for granted and I had enough."""

I met this girl when I was 17, she was 1.5 years younger than me. (I’m 22 now). When we met we immediatelly felt some energy towards each other and on the second time we met we made out for an entire night (we were young, hooking up wasn’t on the table back then). She was and still is the most beautiful, attractive girl I’ve ever met. I immediatelly fell in love with her that night. After that night, began a friendship that I’ve never experienced before or after. We spent a lot of time together, talking about absolutely anything and everything freely, supporting each other, and having so much fun together. After a while I confessed my feelings for her, and I was rejected, she said she saw me as her best friend. So I did the logical choice and cut her out completely. Just 3 months later, we randomly met and both immediately agreed to continue being friends because we enjoyed each others company so much. 6 months later, she got into a relationship with a guy that used to be my best friend, but I parted ways with him before they got together. They were in a relationship for more than a year, and throughout that whole time me and her remained very close friends, although I was totally in love with her. Her bf was very jealous of me at the time, and she complained to me how he treated her a lot. After a year they broke up because she finally cheated on him with me, after that I thought that she would finally give me a chance. For half a year after that she acted very distant with me, because she was grieving for her ex and had confused feelings towards me. Basically she said that she was very attracted towards me but didn’t want to commit. During that time she went on dates with other guys which hurt me very deeply because at the same time she was hooking up with me. After that half a year she finally got into a relationship me but it began on a very bad note because I was hurt and tired of her behaviour, and she still didn’t fully commit, like we both knew were were a couple but we didn’t talk about it for a long time… Yeah, I do realise how childish that is, but back then we had absolutely no idea how to communicate in healthy ways or how to deal with relationship issues, so we had a lot of communication problems… After a year, she broke up with me. For a year after the initial break up, we were together on and off, still trying to work something out, but tbh it was horrible because she kept seeing other people (I also did, but during an “off” period). One more year after that she finally told me that she doesn’t want to be with me and in return I told her that I can’t do this anymore so I made the decision to cut her off completely. A few months later I found out that she fell in love with a new guy, she’s probably still with him. During the last 6 months she tried to contact me a few times and told me that she misses me and wants me in her life as a friend but I couldn’t allow that to happen all over again. Needless to say, it was one of the most painful decisions of my life. I feel like I’m grieving for 2 different people at the same time - my romantic ex partner and then my best, closest friend. I still think about her a lot, it’s so hard to wrap my head around all of this….The thought of her being with someone else is just crushing, man…"""

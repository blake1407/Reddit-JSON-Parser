tifu,InfiniteBusiness0,t2_5xel56q3,t3_18u1yl3,,12/29/23 19:23,0,1316,0.89,181,"""TIFU by telling my date that I was the worlds biggest fan of dick. This wasn  today. It was a few weeks ago. After leaving a long-term relationship a few months ago, I thought I would try dating apps. While I didn  have high hopes, I matched with someone I almost immediately found fascinating. After a texting back-and-forth for a fortnight, we met up at a local cafe for lunch. While chatting, I bring up that Ive been listening to loads of audiobooks recently. She says that shes been working through a list of ""best of all time"" films. Most recently, she explained, she had watched Blade Runner (the original one) and had loved it. Blade Runner is loosely based on Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, which Ive read several times. Ubik (which by the same author) is one of my favourite books. Please read it. These books were written by Phillip K Dick. He also wrote Man in the High Castle and A Scanner Darkly. Basically, he wrote some damn, damn, good books. After enthusiastically talking about these books, she comments that I obviously like them a lot. Looking her dead in the eyes, I said ""I am probably the worlds biggest fan of dick"". I said it too loudly. It was a small cafe. I hadn  said it was a joke. I said it like I really meant it. I had been earnest in telling the entire cafe that I loved dick. People had obviously heard. She bursts out laughing. I don  mean that she lightly chuckled. I mean that she started howling and cackling with laughter. After a few minutes, were scolded by an embarrassed barista. Someone had complained about us being too loud. We had finished eating, so we awkwardly apologise and leave. Afterwards, she explained that she wasn  really laughing at what I had said. Instead, she explained that she couldn  stop laughing because my smile had immediately dropped, I went bright red, and looked like a deer caught in the headlines of an upcoming truck. For reference, I am extremely prone to blushing. In the moment, I was worried that she must have thought I was being laddish and juvenile joke, when I had actually really meant it. Weve not spoken much since then. Weve both had to travel long distances to visit our families for Christmas and New Year, which has been hectic for both of us. However, every time that we have spoken, its come up. Shes told some of her friends about it. Apparently, she met up with a nice guy, but he shouts in public places about how much he likes dick. He enjoys telling the world about it, apparently. If the relationship goes anywhere, I have a feeling that she will never forget about it. TLDR - Matched with cutie on dating app. Went to a cafe. Told them Im a big fan of Phillip K. Dick. He really wrote some great books, you know. Except I said it as ""Im the worlds biggest fan of dick"". She starts howling with laughter. We get told off for being loud. She keeps bringing it up. EDIT: I should have prefaced this by saying that Im awful at reading people. I can never really tell what theyre thinking and how they are perceiving me. Its been nice to read that folks seem to think that this isn  too bad."

Narrator- Youre probably wondering how I got here  . It all started when I let my 10 year old watch Mean Girls a few weeks ago. (Maybe an f-up in some peoples eyes,  but I love that movie). She asked what ""Is your muffin buttered?"" meant. I believe when your kid asks questions, you as a parent should answer them, honestly so they will keep asking you instead of asking kids who don  know what theyre talking about. I told her its another way of asking if youve had sex with someone. I shared a fun fact that the line was supposed to actually be ""Is your cherry popped?"", which is a more common term for losing your virginity. I thought nothing more of the subject. Fast forward to Christmas Eve and were at my very conservative in-laws house playing a game of Say Anything. . The game goes as follows:. -Everyone takes turns being the picker. The picker gets a card and reads a question aloud. -The rest of the players write down an answer on a mini dry erase board they think the picker will choose. -When you write down your answer, you place it on the table face-up.  -The picker secretly pics their favorite and writes it on their board and places it face down on the table.  -Everyone guesses what they think the pickers favorite answer is by placing colored tokens on the mini board. It was my 14-year old nieces turn as the picker and her card said ""What is the worst question you can ask someone on a first date?"" . My neice says, ""Don  make it PG rated just because Im young. I want it to be funny!"". My 10-year old says ""I have a funny answer, but I don  know if I can say it!"". I thought how bad can it be, shes in 5th grade!. I confidently, said ""Its ok, you can write it."". Lo and behold there on the yellow mini dry erase board in moderately legible handwriting with two little cherries for adornment ""Is your cherry popped?"". OMG I DIEDDDDD!!!!. Thankfully my in laws have come a long way and were able to laugh it off. eventually.  It became a call back later in the game when my brother-in-laws question was ""What would be the worst thing for the driver to say to you when you get into a cab?"" My mother-in law answered ""The answer Talya gave a few minutes ago!"". . TL;DR; I told my 10-year-old daughter she could put down whatever she wanted as an answer to a game question. She ended up using a sexual innuendo in front of my conservative in-laws."

According to a 2003 National Institute of Justice report, 3 out of 4 adolescents who have been sexually assaulted were victimized by someone they knew well. The Department of Health and Human Services’ Children’s Bureau report Child Maltreatment 2010 found that 9.2% of victimized children were sexually assaulted. Studies by David Finkelhor, Director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center, show that 1 in 5 girls and 1 in 20 boys are victims of child sexual abuse."" - . 63% of 16,6% = 10,5% lets be generous and say only half of those have children themselves.

Hey fellow Redditors, today I royally messed up, and I cant believe how absurdly dumb I was. So, there I am, sipping on my morning coffee, feeling like a genius because I thought I could outsmart my Roomba. I decided to play a little game with my robotic vacuum. You know, make life interesting. I attached a string to it and tied the other end to a small toy car. My brilliant idea was to let the Roomba drag the toy car around the house, creating a DIY automated remote-controlled car. Genius, right?. Well, the Roomba had other plans. It took off like a rocket, racing through my living room with the toy car in tow. Everything seemed perfect until it hit a snag—literally. The string got caught on a chair, and the Roomba, not realizing it was tethered, tried to make a great escape, dragging the chair along for the ride. Long story short, my DIY project turned into a disaster. My Roomba went on a rampage, knocking over furniture, pulling curtains down, and creating chaos. It even managed to flip the toy car, causing it to crash into a vase, which shattered into a million pieces. Now Im left with a destroyed living room, a Roomba that probably hates me, and the realization that I am definitely not the smartest person in the room. . TL/DR: TIFU by underestimating the power of a rebellious Roomba and turning my house into a robot-induced war zone. Lesson learned, never challenge your appliances to a game they didnt sign up for."

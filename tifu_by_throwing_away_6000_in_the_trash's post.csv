A month ago I decided to go through my safe as I needed to put my daughters birth certificate away. This led me to looking through all the paperwork within.  It seemed as though we were putting things in it that really didnt belong.  I kept our cash in a paper envelope stuffed under a shelf. Over the years it had gotten torn and I recall I wanted to put it in something sturdy. So as papers were coming out I started looking at things on my closet shelf and debating what was important or not.  I had some old owners manuals and letters from my dad.  This had me opening more drawers and more papers were coming out. I noticed we had coin books in the safe and on my closet shelf so I moved those to the kitchen to organize.  From here its all foggy but at some point I threw things away. My wife of 22 years called me while I was offshore at work inquiring about the cash as she wanted to get me a surprise gift without going into our bank account.  The only thing I could think and continue to think is its in the trash. While I was still offshore my wife emptied the safe and the closet to no avail.  She even gutted the office as she thought maybe I got sidetracked getting the envelope.  She also went thru my Lego hobby room and our bedroom.  Its gone. Since being home I repeated what my wife did in all rooms.  No cash.  Since this happened there isnt more than a second that goes by without thinking of this. I dont sleep and my heart races non stop.  Im taking sleep aids to get more than 2 hours of sleep as I wake up having panic attacks.  Im worried about my mental health and overall well being as this is just absolutely stupid on my behalf. So now I type this as a form of therapy.  I dont know what to do besides get over it but I just cant. TLDR; While cleaning my closet and safe I threw out $6000 in cash."

I was very distraught, but was able to forget about it when my parents sent me $100. I had been surviving on $40 a month. I couldn’t even buy all the textbooks I needed on that budget. In hindsight, I should have tried work/study job. Then 20 yrs later, I found a $20 bill on the sidewalk when I lived in Manhattan! So I came out ahead in the long run."""

It hasn’t gotten easier, in fact this year’s holiday season was worse than last year. Now I’m doing my best to focus on our best times, not the hard times. It’s a gradual learning process, and it requires mental discipline. One must make a conscious decision to stop feeling so bad. It’s not easy, but at least it helps us move forward. Turn regret into respect. Respect that you did your best, and got it right most of the time."""

A very annoying mistake of course but these things happen! I have broken bones from carelessness which cost me weeks of paid work and free mobility and I can look back on those times now and laugh. $6000 is a fair chunk but money comes and goes, and its just a material item. There are other things worth so much more. This is relatively small potatoes but I forfeited £300 holding deposit last month because the landlord of the place we were planning to move into turned out to be a psychopath. I dont regret throwing that money away even for a second because my happiness is worth more. I hope youre able to let this go. Best of luck!"""

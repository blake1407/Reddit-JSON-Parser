I went to a friends house for a game night, and his wife is Puerto Rican. Apparently, there is a hot sauce they make called Pique. Its lightly fermented unblended hot suace.  I had never had, or for that matter, even heard about it before. So I try some on my food and its delicious! Im normally not a fan of extremely hot foods, but this was beyond flavorful!. Before I left for the night, the wife offered me a bottle of her homemade Pique. I gladly accept! I take the bottle and head to the car. Well, its currently really cold outside. And my eyes start to water from the bitter cold. So I wipe my eye without giving a second, though  thats where the F-Up happened. See, since we dont currently live in Puerto Rico, the wife has to use whats at her disposal. She just happened to use Carolina Reapers in her sauce. I just touched my eye with Carolina juice all over my hands!. Thanks to my blunder, I am currently laying in bed with my eye swollen shut. Tl:DR I touched my eye after handling a bottle of hot suace that was made with Carolina Reaper peppers."

Most common one used over here is the ""Chile de árbol"" but really any can be used. My grandma used to make a mean one with Serrano, Habanero and Chile de árbol all mixed."""

I found out the hard way too and ran to a pharmacy when my hands and face were bright red and burning after handling peppers and touching my face. . The pharmacist told me about the vinegar. I grabbed a big bottle of it and ran out to the parking lot where I basically bathed in it. It was instant relief."""

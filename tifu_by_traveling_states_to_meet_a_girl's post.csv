tifu,wildnstuff,t2_6khny28w,t3_18sir5x,,12/27/23 21:34,0,35,0.67,33,"""TIFU by traveling states to meet a girl. Obligatory didn  happen today, occured late October of this year but finally felt I could tell this story. So several months ago (almost a year I think) I was scrolling TikTok and came across a live with a small girl friend group. I (22m) joined and we talked and we all got along very very very great. There was three girls but two are best friends (both 26F). So we all follow each other and we have similar jobs (I was a sub teacher and theyre elementary teachers). The mutual friend keeps pestering me to dm and try to date her friend, which I do because shes cute and funny, we had great chemistry and similar job roles. Thing is, I was in Georgia (moved states but not too far), theyre however in Iowa. So months and months go by and comes summer, and were going live on tiktok almost daily for those months especially summer. Were planning spring break trips, laughing, doing tiktok battles, giving those friendly ""mean jabs"" but nothing too serious, just light-hearted jokes, doing drinking games etc. Mind you at this point me and the mutual friends friend are texting everyday and getting to know each other. Come the next school year I save up and buy tickets to meet her. Months pass and comes late October, theres some last minute issues with my flight (and if youve never been to the Atlanta airport, its stressful to say the least, this didn  help but got a resolution). Ended up having to land in Chicago, layover to St. Louis (which I planned to go to anyways so no biggie) and had to take a greyhound bus ride to Iowa. Got on the bus at 12pm, got to Iowa close to 12am, stopping at skethcy and dirty bus stops and such on the way. Well since I got to Iowa late, the girls were in bed and I was tired so no biggie. Next day, first full day there, the girl I was talking to was busy that day, idk why thats all I was told, so the mutual friend and I hung out for a few hours, went to her place and watched a movie, and she dropped me back off at the hotel because she had a date later. Next and last day in Iowa before heading back to St. Louis for personal time, we were supposed to all go to a winery, as the mutual friend said the previous day. So Im texting mutual friend and shes saying I might miss my bus back to Missouri etc etc, and I say I can Uber back early and head out, just wanting to at least see the girl Im talking to in person, and mutual friend says ""girl Im talking to"" (she said her name but Im not saying names) isn  going anymore and its just her (mutual friend) and her date (MFs date). I say okay, never hear from mutual friend again, spend all day in the hotel alone until its time to catch my bus. I text ""girl Im talking to"" sorry I missed her and thought Iowa was amazing, and no response. Several hour bus ride back to St. Louis, had some fun couple days there, and flight back to Georgia Halloween night. Just tonight the girls are at mutual friends place live on tiktok and I went in just to see whats up, and mutual friend is saying ""girl Im talking to"" is single, telling the chat this, and she needs someone, just saying it to the chat and to random men theyre going live with and battling. Dang me.  Oh well. TL;dr Met some cool girls on tiktok, had a lot in common, mutual friend girl told me to try to date her friend, I agreed, me and the girl hit it off and talk almost daily, I take two flights and a several hour dingy bus ride to see her due to last minute issues with Southwest, I land, get ghosted, and now the girl I was talking to his being advertised as single by the mutual friend. Edit: Yes Ive tried dating local for many many years (from high school until now) and no luck. I didn  plan on trying to date this girl until the friend convinced me and then the more we texted and went live, I fell for her and went for it. I didn  want to risk a chance I so rarely get, even if that meant traveling so far. And they knew my age and were fine with it, so that wasn  the issue. Also I was scrolling and just happened to see the live, I didn  go out searching for their account or anything like that. "

Maybe its the age gap, but Ive never understood these internet romances. In your case (no offense) its a Russian roulette of wasted time & resources of whether or not it will work out. Youre so much better connecting with someone (or attempting to connect) with someone in person. At least you know right then and there whether or not theres a future, without the wasted time & money spend on airfare & travel expenses. I wish you well. Every pot has a lid, keep searching."""

Nice convo in the car that just flowed, we had a lot to talk about and it was all around entertaining, got to try canes for the first time with her, and watched deadpool 2 and laughed our asses off, plus her dog warmed up to me way quick and slept right next to me on the couch separate from his owner.

Was she happy about it when you told her you were going there pretty much just to see her?. >I text ""girl Im talking to"" sorry I missed her and thought Iowa was amazing, and no response. . For whatever reason, she was avoiding you the whole time. Maybe you misunderstood her intentions, the back and forth of the messages, etc. and maybe she didn  want to deal with the situation. Call this immaturity, cowardice, caring, prepotence, insecurity from her part, call this whatever you want to call in your head, only you know her, I don  and have no right to say anything. If you are prepared to hear the truth, you could ask your mutual friend to be as honest as possible and tell you why.  Im 99% sure that your friend knows why the other girl has ditched you but, like a caring friend, she doesn  want to hurt you by telling you the reason. If you indeed had a great time and youre not hung up on her, you didn  exactly fed up.  I wouldn  consider what she thought about you going there, though.  you took a chance and it failed, sort of. It can happen when we leave our comfort zone. Take care, happy start of a new year to you!"""

This was a few years ago, I just remembered because I was thinking to cook a meal for someone and it popped into my head. So like many others, cutting onions makes me cry. I’m not proud of that. I’ve tried many methods to stop it and I’m sure some wisdom in the comments will tell me what I’m doing wrong. However this fairly built man, currently leaks like a broken tap the moment  he slices the devils vegetable. . So one day I see the answer staring me in the face. A blender. It’s perfect right. The lid goes on to contain the tear gas. My onions come out perfectly diced. . Wrong, the moment I hit that button, the kitchen becomes a war zone. I can barely see through the water streaming from my eyes. The sting is like a chilli the next morning. I did not know I had that much fluid in my tear ducts. My face is starting to swell and get raw from the furious rubbing of the eyes. And the kitchen is no longer habitable for the next three hours. I did not eat until several hours later. . Never again. Now I refuse to cut onions. I spend the extra cash for prediced. TL;DR put onions in a blender and created a hazardous zone"

Cold onions wont release as much juice as room temp onions.  Chop your onions near the open flame of your grill or gas stove. If you dont have a gas stove, this wont work."""

Have the root side down and slice almost down to the root but leaving it attached. Rotate 90 degrees and cut again. So you will have a cross hatch of onion still attached to the root.  Then turn the onion sideways (root to the side rather than down) and cut your pieces."""

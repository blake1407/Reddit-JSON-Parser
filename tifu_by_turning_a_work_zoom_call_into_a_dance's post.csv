Thought I was being slick by keeping the camera off so I could secretly enjoy a little dance break to my favorite jam. Im talking full-on dance party in my living room. Mid-way through my epic dance routine, I accidentally hit a key on my laptop. Suddenly, Im live on camera, busting moves in front of my boss and colleagues. Theres a moment of stunned silence before everyone bursts out laughing. My boss now suggests a dance break in every meeting. I think Ive accidentally started a new company tradition. Lesson learned: always double-check that camera button. You never know when your living room dance escapades might go company-wide. TL;DR: I unintentionally turned on my camera leading to a moment of awkwardness and now my boss wants to make it a regular thing."

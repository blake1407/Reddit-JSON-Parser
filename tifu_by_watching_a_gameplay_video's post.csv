So yesterday I spent the whole day watching this gameplay of this video game I love, Until Dawn. Its about a group of friends in a lodge that play a prank on one of the girls because shes literally obsessed with another girls boyfriend, Mike. The prank was to film her getting ""naked"" for Mike. They execute the plan and shes so embarrassed that she runs out into the blistering cold, mind you the lodge is on top of a mountain. Her sister runs after her and long story short the sisters falls over a cliff and are presumably dead, but are they?. I watched the gameplay back in 2017 and I remember it recently so I checked it out again. Big, big, big mistake. Im usually not scared of these types of things but man the jumpscares just got to me. I kinda got too into it and when I felt a little tired I was tripping out. Like I heard screaming, a man and a womans voice and I could hear distinctly what they were screaming about. It was ""Help! Please!"" or ""No don  do this"" Man it just creeped me out. So much that I grabbed my rosary and clenched it so hard. One of the reasons why it scared me was because the main antagonist of the game, wendigos, can mimic someones voice to lure you and kill you. I can  be afraid of these things, Im pretty much a grown man. Its just sometimes it gets to you and just creeps you out. Playing the game is way worse tho. No I don  have any mental illness I am a perfectly normal human. I think I learned my lesson tho, never watch creepy games at night. I ended up watching some shows to make me laugh a little and I feel much better now. TL;DR I watched the gameplay of Until Dawn and got creeped out and heard screaming out my window. But it was all just a figment of my imagination."
tifu,sgste,t2xwfn7,t1kfgtb5n,t318tq9bt,12/29/23 16:20,1,2,0,0,"""I once watched a gameplay video of Slenderman. The graphics are nothing to write home about, and the actual game itself is relatively tame when it comes to horror. But I dont usually engage with horror, and watched mainly for the curiosity and because the YouTuber playing was one I was familiar with and whose content I enjoy. That night, I woke up at like 3am, and could have sworn I could see a figure standing in my doorway. I immediately looked away and just sat there with my eyes clenched shut and I tell you, Ive never prayed so hard or earnestly in my life. When I finally had the courage to look again, there was nothing there. The entire thing was freaky."""

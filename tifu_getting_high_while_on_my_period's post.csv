tifu,yer-mommy,t2_4osfv8la,t3_18sx42z,,12/28/23 10:55,0,1394,0.86,200,"""TIFU. So Im a 40 year old mom of 4, and I have extra strength periods. They last anywhere from 7-10 days and are so heavy that I have to wear absorbent period underwear, as well as a super absorbent tampon that I change every 1-2 hours. Its not the most fun, but Ive dealt with it for 30 years, and Ive got my system. Along with my super sized periods come super sized cramps, and these can be absolutely debilitating. I usually spend the first couple of days of my period camped out on the couch with a heating pad and an endless supply of chocolate. My husband is a saint who has always been unfazed by this, and thank God, because this month was going to test our relationship to the max. It was day three of what turned out to be a ten day cycle, and I was feeling some kind of way. The pain was honestly so bad I could barely walk. So my husband suggested I take an edible to try and take the edge off. He had brought back some gummies from a recent trip to California, so I grabbed one and settled in to enjoy some calm while the kids were at school. After an hour or so, it kicked in, and I realized it was a bit stronger than what I was used to, especially since it has been a while since Id partaken. But I was feeling pretty mellow, and the pain wasn  quite so bad. I realized it was time to change my tampon, so I headed for the main floor bathroom. Normally I keep my supplies in my private bathroom upstairs, but I usually keep a few tampons in a discreet jar on a shelf in the main floor bathroom so I don  have to trudge upstairs every hour. But I noticed it was empty. I called to my husband and asked if he could go grab a few for me to refill it, and he was happy to do so. He brought them in, handed me one and placed the rest in the jar. I proceeded to do my business, wiping and cleaning myself, and getting ready to insert my new tampon. Now, I have a ritual which is the same every time. I open the tampon, pull out the applicator so its halfway out, do my business, then insert, put the used applicator back in the package and throw it away. So when I looked down to grab the tampon, imagine my surprise when I realized it was empty and covered in blood. I had already inserted it!. But that is weird. I distinctly remember wiping myself two seconds ago. Why would I be wiping AFTER inserting? Why don  I remember inserting a tampon? OMG I must be higher than I thought!. So I reached down to pull the string, and I couldn  find it. Had I wiped it right up inside myself? Oh God, would I have to root around in there? . All I kept thinking was that this is something that only happens on Reddit. I used a finger to fish around, but I could not find the string. I started to panic. . There was only one thing to do. I had to call in the big guns. I made him promise not to laugh, not to ever tell anyone and not to make me feel stupid. I proceeded to tell him the story. I was so high that I accidently lost a tampon inside myself, and I needed him to get in there and find it. And get in there, he did. He looked and stuck half a hand inside and tried everything he could think of to get the tampon out, but we could not find it. I began to cry. I knew then we would have to go to the hospital, and I was so not looking forward to it. But then my husband stopped in his tracks and said, ""Wait.  Which box was I supposed to bring you tampons from?"" . I looked at him. ""Theres only one box, babe."". He looked mortified. ""Actually there were two.  One that was full, and one that just had a couple in it."". I started into his soul. ""The one with just a couple in it wouldn  by chance have been next to the GARBAGE CAN, would it??"". Yes, dear reader, my husband had brought me two USED tampons because like a good person, I close them neatly after use, and he assumed they were new. So in my marijuana haze, I did not put two and two together until AFTER my vagina had been violated like someone picking raisins out of a potluck potato salad. The moral of the story - even if your husband is a saint, they can still be incompetent. . TL/DR - Husband gave me an edible, made me too stupid to realize just how stupid he was, and we both ended up covered in period blood. Edited to add: Yall - I do NOT actually think my husband is incompetent or stupid. I was writing with humor, and it did not come through as such. My hubs is amazing, and this FU is all mine. Stop DMing me to kill myself or to tell me Im an awful mother (not sure how that is even relevant.). I was simply sharing a funny story. Yikes. "

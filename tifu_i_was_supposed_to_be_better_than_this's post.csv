I got a sms from a number out of my country (first clue). It seamed like my post service,it said that i got a package in their warehouse and i need to confirm my address with a link attached. The link was very strange (second clue) but i still click it, and the site seamed extremely real. So i introduced my information in it. Then it said that there was a tax, a very small amount. So i put the info of one of my cards, it didnt work. So i put the information of my second card and then it worked. So i thought that ,, that was all,, oooh this was just the beginning.  Then i got 6 messages that said the token for one of my cards got suspended and i got suspicious.  But finally i blocked both of my cards about 40 minutes after i put my information down, and i asked the bank  if any of the money were gone, but luckily none of it was gone. . And now I wander how could i possibly made such an obvious mistake. TL;DR - An IT college student made the same mistake as a grandma."

You’re probably gonna receive a lot of hate for being “stupid” and “gullible”, but just take the life lesson and grow from it. Many people fall for these scams and it doesn’t make you lesser for falling for it."""

They go to elaborate lengths to steal money from people. So while you should have been more vigilant, being scammed is not your fault, its the scammers. Close the card, if you put in your SSN freeze your credit and tell your bank. And learn from this mistake."""

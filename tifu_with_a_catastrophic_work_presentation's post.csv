My setup was perfect: notes ready, slides flawless. Except for one tiny detail. My cousin had been playing on my laptop and turned on this cat filter. I start the presentation, talking about financial forecasts, totally unaware I look like a talking cat. Im five minutes in when I finally notice, seeing my reflection in a colleagues glasses. Theres an awkward pause, followed by bursts of laughter from the clients. My boss is trying to stay serious, but even he cracks a smile. The rest of the meeting had this weird mix of professionalism and occasional giggles. Silver lining: the clients thought it made the meeting memorable and fun. Im now the unofficial mascot of the finance team, whiskers and all. &#x200B;. TL;DR: Im now the unofficial mascot of the finance team after showing them my cat filter during presentation"

We go out, things are going great, better than I hoped. Were laughing, chatting, its like a scene from a rom-com. Then comes the end of the night, the big goodbye. My brains screaming, ""Play it cool, play it cool."" But what does my mouth say? ""I love you."" Not in a casual, jokey way, but in a deep, soulful, gaze-into-your-eyes kind of way. The silence that followed was deafening. They chuckled nervously, mumbled something about ""moving fast,"" and practically sprinted to their car. I stood there, mortified. Needless to say, I didn  get a text back. Now, I practice my goodbyes in the mirror like some weirdo, making sure ""I love you"" doesn  slip out again.r  . . TL;DR: I accidentally dropped an ""I love you"" bomb on the first date, and now Im stuck in a cringe-worthy memory loop every time I say goodbye.rr"

It was nerves and what you meant to say was . Then ask them to do something casual and make a joke promising you wont propose."""

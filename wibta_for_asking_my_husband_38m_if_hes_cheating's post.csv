I never had any doubts about him.I have an athletic body. I’m very healthy but I am not small.We have joint finances and I noticed an unusual purchase. My husband had bought expensive lingerie arriving today. I looked into it.On one hand, it’s too small for me and built for a petite skinny woman with no muscles. And I have never worn lingerie. I don’t even know if I would be confident in lingerie.And he knows my size. He’s bought clothes for me before, including underwear, and has never been wrong. This so is clearly the wrong size, way too small for me. The brand has undercarriage, waist and hip sizes.My husband is handsome and has women throwing themselves at him. I have no doubt that if he wanted to he could easily get an affair partner.On the other hand, it could conceivably be an insanely tight fit on me. And he’s shipping it to our home address instead of his office.He didn’t have anything incriminating on his phone but we share phones so it could mean nothing.WIBTA for confronting him about the lingerie? I don’t want my husband to feel that I don’t trust him but I don’t have any other explanations.Edit: I have never worn lingerie in my life. He hasn’t bought me lingerie before.\xa0It’s very frilly and cute, not something that would suit me even if it fit.He is a perfectionist and has never bought me the wrong size in clothes. If it was a mistake in sizing he would have called weeks ago when it was ordered. The lingerie has actual measurements and my husband knows my measurements.Edit: I am not going to be home when the package arrives. I don’t open packages anyways.It’s way way way too small to fit my husband. I know a few women it would fit.I don’t usually go through credit card transactions. If I hadn’t looked at them to cancel a subscription I wouldn’t have noticed the pricey credit card charge to a lingerie store.Our children are young. If they stole the credit card, my husband would have immediately noticed and shut it down. It’s entirely inappropriate for children.,

It was a major sale amd she wound up with bras that would more than likely fit our 4 year old grandaughter than her. I was ordering some workout bras from tomboy X and they were having a sale. I was searching for 2X but as I jumped around from pattern to pattern if the pattern I was looking for didn\t have my size it would jump to the next lower size that was available. I don\t think that this was done with bad intentions. I think it has to do with the way the site was programmed to keep people from clicking on an out of stock size..

From the way you talk of him it doesn’t sound like getting lingerie for someone other than either if you is something your husband would mess up on. I read ur other responses and whatever is going on deserves an explanation.. after you’ve given him the opportunity to gift to you. Maybe he’s testing you? (Messed up for sure) maybe it’s for a blow-up doll and a new kink maybe that size was on sale and he wants to have it altered for you. Whatever the reason I’d steer away from jumping to conclusions and be sure to word your questioning in a way that doesn’t accuse. I am sorry you are going thru this!! How mind-boggling!!!

Maybe he mis-clicked the size or reviewers stated that the item runs really large. To me it seems without any further proof I’d worry that you’re going to falsely insinuate something without any reason to. If package comes and he doesn’t give to you ask about the package!! See what his reaction is. Not sure why he wouldn’t tell you if it was some white elephant gift or be so careless to ship to house. Just a lot here you wouldn’t want to damage something without more reason to.

None of that is on the bank/credit card statement.Let me suggest a few options other than that your otherwise "perfectionist" husband suddenly forgot that he shouldn\t use his shared credit card to buy his mistress lingerie and have it delivered to your house.1. You have "two beautiful children."  Is one of them of lingerie-buying age?  Did they maybe use his credit card or take advantage of a saved card?\n2. Is it possible your credit card was hacked?  Here\s how it works. Someone gets your credit card number and wants to confirm that it will work.  They find a site and keep submitting orders with each successive card number and billing address they\ve stolen.  When they get a combination that works they know they can charge more to that card later. But they\re not going to put in their *own* shipping address. They just put in the buyer\s.\n3. You seem to have spent a considerable amount of time on the lingerie shop\s website.  Maybe he wants you to get something.  If you really want to get to the bottom of this without accusing him purchase the *exact same thing* but in the right size and surprise him with it one night.  You can pretend you didn\t know about his order *or* you can pretend that it\s the set he ordered and you were so surprised that you just had to put it on.See how he reacts.,

She is someone with a fine jewelry collection and likes to go through it every so often. When she did I admired one of the pieces and she said “Oh that you can have it I never want to see it again.” Turns out her husband went on a business trip and brought her back a piece of jewelry for her that she happily accepted. But when she went to empty his suitcase she found this other piece. She knew when she saw the other jewellery that it was meant for his receptionist who my SIL suspected of having an affair with her husband so she approached him and gushed about the other piece as if it was meant for her. He didn’t have the guts to counter her so she kept the other jewellery and hated it and I innocently became the recipient of the beautiful jewelry the spoils of her husband’s affair.,

Do u have friends that could fit this scenario? That’s pretty far fetched tho right ks04lql krzvz5i ks05ubk ks198yb],
